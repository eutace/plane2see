I learned about it at least 10 years ago when an AA regional flight was cancelled to LAX and I hitched a rental car ride with a French businessman. He was flying AF and since he was driving I called to rebook him. I had no idea what their numbers were so I clicked on the top one in the search. Got through a 20 minute call to the $700 charge and the guy was handing me his credit card to rebook it when I hung up. Everything was screaming scam in my brain. The poor guys mouth dropped like I was a crazy person. 🤣 I said I don’t think they are the real AF. This guy was in La Premiere and I couldn’t imagine them charging him anything. I googled better this time, navigated to the AF website and called from there. They changed his flight for free in less than two minutes. They are basically scammer travel agents who charge for the rebooking. They do rebook you though for the most part. I’m sure there’s some who may resell your credit card info as well for extra cash or some who don’t rebook you. I learned never to look at those sponsored numbers again.

My personal explanation on why Delta was hit harder than any other airline is very favorable one to Delta. Hold on, hold on, let me explain before accusing me of licking Ed’s sneakers! Based on the info floating around that time, unlike the competition, every Delta device (including laptops of all employees, agent terminals, and even baggage self-check-in kiosks) is encrypted. That is a very very good thing from the infosec perspective. The problem is that when Crowdstrike hit, Delta IT couldn’t just remote into many devices - they had to physically decrypt each device to install Crowdstrike’s correction that came out later that morning (or was it just a rollback to a previous version?) At any case, that created a much larger initial effect, which started feeding on itself, overwhelming all systems. Lots has been said about Delta’s outdated crew tracking systems, but it’s not like other carriers have much more modern technology.

1oit7k3,nly3tnl,1oit7k3,1,0.1,comment,,"Short answer is no, a PS5 draws too much power to run off an outlet on a plane. The long answer is power outlets on a plane have a much lower maximum wattage than a normal home outlet. Typically, the maximum wattage is 75W, though some newer planes will max out at 100W. Once the usage exceeds the limit, the breaker for the outlet will trip, and power will be cut. For comparison, a typical outlet on a 15A circuit in a home can handle 1800W (it's not a perfect comparison, but hopefully there are no electricians here to slam me for skipping over the intricacies). A PS5 has a 350W power supply, and during typical gaming it uses around 200W. You may be fine turning it on and staying on the home screen, but pretty much as soon as you try to play any modern game, you will trip the breaker on the outlet.",ajwright15,5,,0,2025-10-29 11:07:21,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1oit7k3/is_it_possible_to_play_video_games_with_a/nly3tnl/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1oit7k3/is_it_possible_to_play_video_games_with_a/nly3tnl/,,,False,False,False

On a recent connection through Detroit, my inbound was almost 2 hours late because of a maintenance issue in YYZ. We landed in DTW with enough time to run to the gate (which I did) and arrived at the departure gate 13 minutes before the scheduled. For some crazy reason, daddy Delta decided this flight should leave 5 mins early (minus 4 passengers who misconnected and not in anyway necessitated by weather). We were stuck as it was the last flight of the night. On time would have been fine here (and we would have made it to our destination). I'm scratching my head.

1ohmcpp,nlqv2ap,1ohmcpp,1,0.25,comment,,Last flight of the day probably means that the GAs and Pilots decided to file for an early departure which they are technically allowed to do..and for some reason they think that they (GAs) get to close up shop and leave a few minutes early (this frequently happens in SAN..ask me how I know and to add insult to injury the ac just sat there with the jet bridge pulled back because they buttoned up way too early.. I was delayed at security because TSA decided to do training that night..anyway) I too was left but at least on that evening I was a lowly employee trying to get back to ATL for New Years. I often travel on paid tickets but I digress. Bottom line they should not have left you because they are only supposed to depart early if A) dispatch allows them to and if they have all revenue passengers accounted for and boarded. They knew that you were coming and chose to screw you over on the last flight of the day no less. I would totally not just complain but would address a letter to both marketing and customer care.

Your bag looks similar to what i could find from a small chain pet store on the side of the road that I honestly didn’t check the size chart. I just kept the “fits under plane seat” sticker on in hopes no questions were asked. Worked for both UAL and DAL. Given the wide-scale issue of pet owners faking the service dog schtik, following the rules will likely not raise any brows. All seats are roughly going to have the same under-seat space for the carrier. On the den-atl leg, I asked the purser if I could lay the carrier up in the middle seat and let the gasper blow on the bag, to which I was told to just not allow them out of the case (had no intent to, was asleep anyways). As a tip, the sidewalls on the window seats vent air from the cabin down the sidewalls of the plane and around the cargo areas. Your dogs I believe have known respiratory issues and this may be of some benefit to them for some small, but additional airflow. The only downside is that the sidewalls curve inwards and typically take up a few inches of footspace. Whatever you do, book asap, as Delta (at least two years ago) limit the amount of pets allowed in the cabin on flights between the different classes on the plane. Probably little to no other chance of others flying their pets on your same flights, but it’s still a chance. There are some natural formulas available out there also that will lower their chances of needing to hit the head as well and can help for the over night flight.",Swagger897,2,,1,2025-10-29 10:50:09,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1ohwdi8/flying_with_dogs_in_roverlund_carrier/nly16df/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1ohwdi8/flying_with_dogs_in_roverlund_carrier/nly16df/,,,False,False,False

I remember we headed out early to a large international airport once that had great food, shopping and we had lounge access so rather than sit at the hotel we opted to spend time there. We forgot that the Delta counters aren’t manned until 2.5 hours before check-in there.

The first 8hr of which was like a dozen separate 30-60min delays when nobody, gate agent and other crew members included, thought there was any chance at all it would actually leave at the new scheduled time… when a potential replacement pilot or first officer or attendant hasn’t even answered their phone to see if they can work the flight definitely isn’t leaving in 30min, yet Delta pretended it would over and over and over.

I understand it's for fraud prevention and whatnot, but will be a huge headache for a lot of people- especially those who booked before the change was implemented. It could strand a teen who's trying to return from spring break, or a kid with divorced parents if one bought round trip tickets. Hell, it affects my own kid who was looking forward to flying by himself soon. So does this mean teens flying solo need to have someone on origin buy their outbound ticket and someone at the destination buy their return ticket? That will complicate school related trips abroad, too. And then, if the person associated with the name on the card has to be present, that sucks for anyone married who purchased their ticket with a card they're authorized to use but has their spouse's name. Which, yes, you can get a card with your name as an authorized user, but if you bought a ticket before this was implemented, what, is your only option to call and rebook at a much higher fare? Heck, idk how many times I've booked my spouse a flight and just muscle-memory entered my own card info, or vice versa. I feel for anyone who booked their holiday tickets when fares were lower only to discover the morning of their flight that their only option is to rebook for 4x the price. I also feel for the front line agents who will have to deal with alllllllll of this. Will also slow things down at the check in counters during peak travel season.

You steal their CC number and book the flight. Weeks later, they realize the fraudulent charge and do a chargeback/fraud investigation. The charge is voided, and the airline is out the money because the ticket was already flown. Thus, when you book a ticket that is at high risk for fraud (based on last-minute purchase, itinerary, area of the world, etc), they make you show the card to prove it’s not stolen. And no, they’re not going to tell you the precise combination of factors that make them think it’s fraud, because then the fraudsters would just…not do those things. The good news is that the card just has to be verified by any airline employee. If a relative booked for you, they can go to any airport and show the card at the Delta counter. And if you booked with a card that you can’t physically show…yeah, you’re kind of SOL, because that’s exactly the kind of situation this policy is designed to shut down.",Cephandrius13,2,,0,2025-10-21 19:35:22,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1oa4w3a/i_thought_this_was_common_practice_but_i_was/nkl1spz/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1oa4w3a/i_thought_this_was_common_practice_but_i_was/nkl1spz/,,,False,False,False

The ones that are most consistently available in my experience are the KLM Crown Lounges in AMS (Lounge 52 in non-Schengen area & Lounge 25 in the Schengen area) and the Salons Air France in CDG (1 in each of the concourses in terminal 2E, also 2F, not sure about G). You should be able to access those as a SkyTeam Elite+ member. The terminology to use when you visit one is STE+, not saying you’re Delta Gold Medallion. They will scan your boarding pass any way, so they would be able to see it. On occasion in the past in my experience (since early 2000s), the KLM lounges would restrict Delta medallion access to only business class during times of heavy travel before they redid lounge 25 & lounge 52. The lounges that I’m most familiar with that are tricky are in places where SkyTeam does not OWN a lounge, but instead they have contracts with third party-owned lounges like the Joan Miró lounge in Nice or the lounge in Marseille. Same in Lisbon, Athens, Rome where there is not a big SkyTeam presence, same deal. Their contracts with most of these lounges only pay the lounge for business class passengers, so unless you’re in D1 or equivalent SkyTeam business class, you have no access just as a SkyTeam Elite+ member.",OkAfternoon6688,1,,1,2025-10-12 05:36:49,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1o437gn/just_got_gold_it_says_i_have_global_lounge_access/nj07tmz/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1o437gn/just_got_gold_it_says_i_have_global_lounge_access/nj07tmz/,,,False,False,False

Personally, I travel through ATL a lot (Thanks to Delta removing its hub status from MEM, so no more direct flights in and out of there, but that's another issue altogether), and I love it. It's actually very easy to navigate, with clearly marked signs and directions to get from place to place. I've never met a rude staff member or even one that was nonchalant, but then, I've never been an entitled or impatient passenger either. I love the tree art installation between Concourses A and B, as well as the history tunnel, but would love to see more things like this between the terminals that are farther afield. My best advice for anyone booking through ATL is to make sure you book at least an hour between connections because you never know when you might need it... honestly, ATL is the one airport that I've flown through that is notorious for being the type of airport that when you need a delay, there won't be one, but when you don't need one, there will be one.

I fly from Seattle, and I'm beginning to find \*huge\* price differences for Delta flights compared to anyone else, for no justifiable reason. For example, looking at SEA to NYC in November. Delta wants $2900. Alaska, $1600. Business class cabin has only 2 seats sold. Just booked a flight to Savannah, Georgia. Delta wanted \*$3000\*. Almost empty business class. United wanted $2200. As I was changing a previously booked flight and didn't choose business class, they wouldn't even let me book comfort--not an option. Had to settle for main cabin for $600. The agent said that the premium comfort was 'blocked' for me as they would only allow selling it on new tickets. I've seen other posts about Delta punishing single travelers with high costs like this. It's nuts. Delta used to cost about 10% more than other airlines for business in my experience. 50% more is totally unrealistic, unacceptable. Is there something going on about this as a new pricing scheme?

There is a big difference in both hard and soft product. Occasionally DeltaOne equipped planes will end up on different domestic routes with standard first class service. 2.

Then once booked cancel the ticket within the 24 allowed hours and the ticket would be refunded to the cc you purchased it from so no worries about a credit vs full refund.

Generally, airlines do use their own employees at the gate even internationally.

Some airlines, rarely, even have a member of a flight crew staff the gate at smaller airports who will arrive/depart on that aircraft as well (not so much with the mainlines but can happen) So indeed, they were probably bumped or moved by someone at Air France and not Delta.",getchpdx,1,,0,2025-09-29 15:36:33,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1nsxwhn/delta_air_france_or_tour_company/ngsi9wo/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1nsxwhn/delta_air_france_or_tour_company/ngsi9wo/,,,False,False,False

On a connecting leg from one flight to another, the French passport holders somehow all made the connecting flight while others were left behind in security lines. Just all sorts of discriminatory behavior. I don’t doubt for a minute that you were bumped. Now it honestly could have been a pilot thing as I have seen that too where the need extra seats for pilots and they get priority in business, but I also wouldn’t put it past them just based on our experiences.

Most, if not all new builds (NEOs, MAXs) have massive, and I mean massive bins. This won’t be a problem in 10-15 years. The new problem? Those bins are now higher, the FA needs a stick to close the bins on the NEO if they are under 6’ tall. It will never be perfect. One factor to look into is passenger reading comprehension. Every flight there are several people that just can’t find their seat number or letter, at all. They stop traffic and take forever, making boarding take longer.

1nmqk6h,1nmqk6h,,0,0,post,flying to cancun with passport that expires in less than 6 months,"Hi everyone, I am leaving for cancun in 3 weeks for my honeymoon. i had a poor understanding about the passport expiration and international travel guidelines (that it differs by country). I am flying delta to cancun with a passport that expires in less than 6m. Cancun's law allows for entry as long as the passport is vaild during your time there. Delta's website says their guidelines say that ""*in general, your passport should be valid at least six months beyond the period of intended stay in a foreign country*"". I did speak with a Delta representative and they said that they just go by the rules of the country you're flying into, so I should be fine but was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and what their outcome was. *EDIT: thanks for all of the replies! Additionally, I chatted with a Delta representative with documented messaging, saying that I would have no trouble getting in or out of the country. They said this would be a one time courtesy though which I thought was strange. I did screenshot the conversation, but I think I will end up getting an urgent passport appointment and trying to renew that way to ease my anxiety.",Turntowardsthesun,3,0.64,23,2025-09-21 20:23:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1nmqk6h/flying_to_cancun_with_passport_that_expires_in/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1nmqk6h/flying_to_cancun_with_passport_that_expires_in/,False,True,False,False,False

1nlomdw,1nlomdw,,0,0,post,Credit situation question,Hi I am looking for some information or advice on a situation. My family and I were suppose to go on a vacation to FL last October. As there was a hurricane making landfall the day before we left we decided it was best to postpone the trip. Delta was offering people a no penalty cancellation for full value credit to be used at the later date on rebooking. We received those in an email right after cancellation. This email was unlike other credits I have received in the past because it did not list a specified issue date and more importantly have no mention of a definitive expiration date. It simply said to “be used within a year or more of the original purchase date”. That to me reads that it could be used for a period longer than a year. We just tried to redeem them and delta says they are expired because we originally purchased the flights in Aug. 2024 so we are over the period. But nowhere did it say this date specifically and when we cancelled it was not a typical situation because we opted to cancel due to extenuating circumstances of a hurricane. Maybe I’m more upset than I should be but 4 tickets was a lot of money and we were trying to not travel to a tropical storm and had used credits in the past with no issues. Any advice of info appreciated on how to get help.,DatabaseHealthy1019,0,0.5,25,2025-09-20 12:20:46,https://i.redd.it/e65sdhxnx8qf1.jpeg,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1nlomdw/credit_situation_question/,False,False,False,False,False

1mz5skz,1mz5skz,,0,0,post,Delta is the worst airline in US.,"Flying this awful airline the 4th time this year unfortunately - it baffles me how awful their service is end to end. Mind you I’ve flown probably over 50-60 flights already this year on 6+ airlines so I do have something to compare this service or lack thereof to. Waited this long to post as I kept hoping this is all one-off experiences, no this is a consistent and abusive to customers. 1. No gate closing time on boarding passes (and bs opening times also for international flights where it’s at least 20 mins earlier than they actually begin boarding) 2. Nasty flight attendants that are only self servingly filling the closet and bins in the front with their own personal items and making business class (or as they ironically like to call it “first”) passengers store their items in the economy class - fully defying the purpose of flying business with expedited exit upon landing. 3. Preventing usage of lounge and Checkin area for fully labeled “Delta One” tickets claiming it has to be “international” and when I show that the ticket is for Canada for example - they say how that’s not applicable as it’s not “far enough”. 4. No help or support seeing which flights are boarding from the lounge or announcements. Onboard, no help with bags or even an offer of water. Absolutely pathetic. Not even any offered support for pregnant passengers. 5. Power high flight attendants with no service or education whatsoever. Just abusing their “power” and not doing anything even slightly remote to hospitality job that they’ve been assigned to. Lack of respect to customers, talking down to every single passenger on board, barking orders, rolling eyes - completely unprofessional and in any other airline would be grounds for dismissal.

1mw01dy,1mw01dy,,0,0,post,Upgrade Companion Ticket??,"I finally utilized the free companion ticket I get for my Amex Platinum Business card on a flight to Las Vegas in December. We usually book comfort plus seats for this flight as the only direct flight on the return to CVG is the red-eye and the extra room is nice when trying to sleep. That wasn’t an option though when using the companion ticket so we have two coach seats. It was worth it though for the price as it was only $489 for the two tickets. Just curious if anyone knows if we can pay to upgrade to Comfort plus later with this type of ticket. I keep reading how business is down in Vegas so we are hoping the flights stay less than full and it’s an option to upgrade. We took advantage of going out during the week to score comped rooms (paying only resort fees) so 4 nights are only going to cost us $226 including taxes at the Horseshoe, It will end up being a cheap trip overall except for food!!",GapSpecialist3606,3,1.0,11,2025-08-21 11:26:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1mw01dy/upgrade_companion_ticket/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1mw01dy/upgrade_companion_ticket/,False,True,False,False,False

1mjz4xc,1mjz4xc,,0,0,post,Advice Needed: Flight Booking Issues Due to Family Emergency,"Hi everyone, I recently faced an unexpected situation and could use some advice. My grandfather passed away, and I had to take an emergency flight home, which means I missed the first leg of a round trip I had planned for my vacation. Initially, I tried to change the first leg of my trip to accommodate the new flight, but the airline's hotline informed me it would cost an additional $700. They explained that they had to break the round trip and rebook the return leg, which is now much more expensive. Under the stress of the situation, I decided to book a separate ticket for $400 (also with Delta). The operator advised me to call on the day of the flight to cancel and get a refund for the first leg. Today, when I called again, they repeated that it would cost $700 to cancel the first leg and keep the return flight. I explained the family bereavement, and they said they would ""waive"" the $700 fee under bereavement policy. I'm feeling a bit lost here. It seems like Delta gets a free seat they can resell, and I've ended up booking three flights. I feel like I should receive some credit for the flight they're going to resell. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do in this situation?

This is where hovering at the gate and advocating for yourself to let them know you're there is critical if you want to make the flight. 2. The reasoning why... it depends how your standby was coded, aka was it done correctly. For Z you should have been given priority B1F which is INCONVENIENCED OR MISHANDLED BY DL if the flight you desired was the one an agent put you on. If they accidentally coded you as C, it means a flat tire, ie: your fault, which yours isn't, but the system doesn't know different. If you initiated it, you were SDSB. Essentially, you could be on an IROP but if you stood by on your own vs the flight you were rebooked on, that's where it gets iffy.",footballfalex56,5,,1,2025-08-06 01:05:42,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1mibf7i/z_class_fare_standby/n7319iw/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1mibf7i/z_class_fare_standby/n7319iw/,,,False,False,False

And would also be less tiresome in traversing fewer airports. And fewer opportunities for delays, missed connections and missing your event(s). Anything A321/A320/737 or above will get you there in similar fashion. (The 767 would be better, but I wouldn’t add complexity of travel and lots of extra connection time to fly it. Even more importantly because you have events you likely don’t want to risk missing.) You might get smaller regional jets out of Knox. So you might want to get to ATL (the closest hub) and then take whatever earliest flight from there out to San Jose. They’ll all be at least 737 or A320/321.

1m1f149,1m1f149,,0,0,post,Delta Switched 8 Hour Layover to 17 Hour Layover in New York,"UPDATE: After hours of hold on delta calls and three attendants in the airport, they saved us 24 hours and got us another flight path for free. Thank you so much to everyone for all of the help, they tried denying us on two separate occasions, but we finally got through to a manager and he had it done in a flash. Really can't thank all the recommendations enough. We would have LOVED the time in New York, but we're just getting off of 3 weeks out of the country and are tired and broke. Lotta hiking and visiting 12 cities so another city is not in our to-do this time. Thanks again! ORIGINAL: New to flying, there's 4 of us flying out Kansas City to London. Total cost was around $6,800 and refundable tickets. We purchased them awhile back and noticed that before our flight from MCI to ATL, they were no longer refundable, even before boarding and checking in. On our way back, we are travelling Heathrow, layover in New York, to KC. Originally it was an 8 hour layover which we were planning on spending in the airport. They changed it to be a 17 hour layover. We didn't budget for plans to stay in New York and have no clue what to do from here. Is this normal? None of us have ever flown internationally, only Southwest somewhat often for domestic flights. A 17 hour layover seems insane to us but we aren't sure what to do at this point. They stripped the refundability and changed it on us. What options do we have or is it just dealing with it?",KirselAndise,35,0.86,27,2025-07-16 23:06:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1m1f149/delta_switched_8_hour_layover_to_17_hour_layover/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1m1f149/delta_switched_8_hour_layover_to_17_hour_layover/,False,True,False,False,False

How are you seeing that you paid for refundable tickets and that Delta “stripped” it? If Delta has a schedule change, there’s an option to change the flights. If you booked a long time ago, schedule changes happen quite. You should be calling Delta about this and seeing what your options are. At this point, I don’t really know what you are wanting, except for maybe a shorter layover. Though, if you’re going to be stuck somewhere for 17 hours, NYC is probably one of the best places. Hop on the JFK AirTrain, take the subway into Manhattan, and go explore around. Sightsee, eat some food, get run over by a taxi or bicyclist, walk past Keanu, hit up a rooftop bar… good times.",enozero,25,,2,2025-07-16 23:20:59,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1m1f149/delta_switched_8_hour_layover_to_17_hour_layover/n3glzqc/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1m1f149/delta_switched_8_hour_layover_to_17_hour_layover/n3glzqc/,,,False,False,False

[See all of our automod responses here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/15neys0/generating_automated_text_responses_to_common/). --- #Schedule Change Following a schedule change by Delta, you typically have three options: 1. Accept the change 2. Request an alternate routing with Delta 3. Cancel for a credit (or refund in certain circumstances) If you wish to accept the change - you typically do not need to take any action. Delta will not pay for any additional accommodation (e.g., extra hotel nights) for changes made known to you in advance of travel. If you would like to request an alternate routing, Delta will typically rebook you on any available same-day Delta marketed itinerary between the same origin and destination, including alternate connection points, waiving any change fee or fare difference. Delta will typically only allow one free change after a schedule change. You may be able to perform the change online, using the change flight feature. However, if you receive an error or the system attempts to charge you, you will need to call or message Delta. Before calling, the rebooking process will be faster if you already know what alternate flight you want. You can find available options on Delta.com by searching for a new flight just like you would for a new purchase. Write down the flight numbers, and tell them to the agent when you call in. There should generally be no charge for this change; you may have to Hang Up and Call Again (HUCA) if the rep is trying to charge you. If you no longer wish to fly, or prefer to book with another carrier, after a schedule change, you can cancel the flight for an eCredit. If the change meets one of the [refund exception criteria](https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/us/en/news/policy-update-archive/2020/august-2020/delta-updates-its-canadian-and-international-contracts-of-carria.html), you may be eligible for a refund instead of an eCredit: * A delay of 120 minutes or more (on either the arrival or departure time) * A change in the routing of a scheduled Delta flight which adds one or more stops to the original itinerary * A change in equipment from Delta Mainline to Delta Connection carrier * Any change that causes a misconnect If the change meets one or more of the exception criteria, and you wish to cancel your travel for a full refund, you can make the request using the [online cancel and refund form](https://www.delta.com/contactus/iropForm). When submitting the form, in the request description, simply state which of the above criteria applies. You will receive an email response to your request in the timeframe indicated at the top of the form. Please note that Schedule Changes are often loaded into schedules on Saturdays. If your itinerary looks pretty messed up, wait til Monday before looking at it again and see if it needs fixing. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This has happened to me both times I’ve flown delta to Asia and bought tickets several months in advance. It’s not a big deal, just call (or chat, I’ve had zero issues with getting changes made over chat)! It’s kinda nice because the cheapest flights don’t always have the most ideal itineraries and you can get booked into better itineraries with no extra charge in these situations. I will say this complimentary change is only valid once so make sure you’re sure about the itinerary you’ve chosen, otherwise you’ll have to pay fare differences the next time you want to make a change.

Summoned via `!eu261` --- #EU261 There are passenger rights in the European Union (EU) known as EU261. They provide for cash compensation if you are subject to certain delays and cancellations, subject to terms. Note that this help message is intended to help you request compensation after your flight. If you still need help with your travel, use `!delay` for some tips and tricks. To be eligible for EU261, you must satisfy all of the following conditions: * You are traveling on a flight **departing from** an airport in the EU **OR** you are on an EU-country carrier like Air France or KLM; |Itinerary|Flying an EU carrier|Flying a non-EU carrier |:-:|:-:|:-:| |Flight from the EU to the EU|Eligible|Eligible| |Flight from the EU to non-EU|Eligible|Eligible| |Flight outside of the EU to the EU^1|Eligible|**Ineligible**^1| |Flight outside of the EU to non-EU (e.g. a single ticket JFK-CDG-BOM)|**Ineligible**|**Ineligible**| * ^1 In case of connecting flights covered by a single reservation, if at least one of the connecting flights was operated by a Community air carrier, the connecting flights as a whole should be perceived as operated by a Community air carrier. In other words, JFK-AMS-HAM with Delta operating JFK-AMS and KLM operating AMS-HAM, a delay on the Delta flight would be covered. This claim could be made against the operator of the second flight (KLM), the Community air carrier involved in the performance of the connecting flights, despite them not being the cause of the delay (Delta). * You have a confirmed reservation (includes Basic Economy); * You present yourself for check-in at the time indicated on your Delta ticket receipt or, if no time is indicated, no later than 2 hours before the time of departure; and * You are traveling on a fare available directly or indirectly to the public, or on a ticket issued under a frequent flyer program. #Delays & Cancellation You are **not** eligible for EU261 if you were made aware of the cancellation: * 2 weeks or more before the scheduled time of departure; * between 2 weeks and 7 days before the scheduled time of departure and you were offered re-routing with a departure no more than 2 hours before the scheduled time of departure and an arrival at your final destination less than 4 hours after the scheduled time of arrival; * less than 7 days before the scheduled time of departure and you were offered re-routing with a departure no more than 1 hour before the scheduled time of departure and an arrival at your final destination less than 2 hours after the scheduled time of arrival (If any of these apply, use `!schedulechange` to see your options) Otherwise, you are covered by EU261 if you experience a flight delay or cancellation that is or should have been controllable by the airline. Examples for ""not controllable by the airline"" include weather, ATC delays, strikes, etc. Examples for ""controllable by the airline"" include mechanical delays, airline equipment failure, crew unavailable (not for weather), etc. Here is the table of compensation: |Category|Length of Flight|Credit Voucher Amount|Cash Amount| |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |A|Flights of 1500 km (~932 miles) or less|€350|€250 |B|Flights within the EU of more than 1500 km, and all other flights between 1500 and 3500 km (~2175 miles)|€500|€400| |C|Flights not falling under A or B|€800|€600 \* This compensation may be reduced by 50% if the arrival time of the alternative flight does not exceed the scheduled arrival time of the flight originally booked by: * Category A - 2 hours * Category B - 3 hours * Category C - 4 hours A cancelled/delayed flight from the EU to the US that delayed your arrival at your destination by at least 4 hours would qualify as Category C for €600. #Downgrading If you are involuntarily placed in a lower class than that for which your ticket was purchased, you are entitled to reimbursement within seven days of: |Category|Length of Flight|Reimbursement| |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |A|Flights of 1500 km (~932 miles) or less|30% of the price of the ticket |B|Flights within the EU of more than 1500 km, and all other flights between 1500 and 3500 km (~2175 miles)|50% of the price of the ticket |C|Flights not falling under A or B|75% of the price of the ticket #Denied Boarding When the airline reasonably expects to deny boarding on your flight, the airline will call for volunteers who are prepared to surrender their confirmed reservation for an agreed compensation in Transportation Credit Vouchers. If not enough volunteers can be found and you are denied boarding against your will, you are entitled to denied boarding assistance and compensation **providing you have met the latest check-in time requirements**. You are not entitled to this assistance and compensation if there are reasonable grounds to deny boarding, such as reasons of health, safety, security or inadequate travel documentation. Denied boarding is not generally specifically defined, so if you show up to your gate on time and are not boarded, this may be considered denied boarding. You may choose between: * rerouting to your final destination under comparable transport conditions as soon as possible, or at a later date at your convenience, subject to the availability of seats; or * reimbursement within seven days of your ticket price for the part or parts of the journey that were not made, and for the part or parts already made if the flight no longer serves any useful purpose, taking into consideration the original flight plan, and, when relevant, also a return flight to the first point of departure as noted on the ticket at the earliest opportunity #Compensation You claim compensation with the airline that operated the flight (most likely Delta, Air France, or KLM). For Delta: * To claim compensation, visit https://www.delta.com/us/en/need-help/overview then select Comments & Complaints -> Submit Feedback -> File a Complaint -> Delayed, canceled, and rebooked flights -> Flight delayed/canceled -> and complete the requested information to ensure proper handling of your claim, ensuring that you cite EU261 compensation requirements. For Air France: * To claim compensation, visit https://wwws.airfrance.us/claim -> Log in via your FlyingBlue account or use the specific confirmation code (PNR) For KLM: * To claim compensation, visit https://www.klm.com/claim -> Log in via your FlyingBlue account or use the specific confirmation code (PNR) For more information, visit the EU261 page here - https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm#delay Country and language specific Delta references: [English version for Ireland](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Ireland.pdf) [Denmark/Danish/Dansk](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Denmark.pdf) [France/French/Français](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/France.pdf) / [Air France English version](https://wwws.airfrance.us/information/legal/assistance-et-indemnisation) [Germany/German/Deutsch](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Germany.pdf) [Greece/Greek/Ελληνικά](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Greece.pdf) [Iceland/Icelandic/íslensku](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Iceland.pdf) [Italy/Italian/Italiano](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Italy.pdf) [Netherlands/Dutch/Nederlands](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Netherlands.pdf) / [KLM English version](https://www.klm.com/information/legal/assistance-compensation) [Spain/Spanish/Español](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Spain.pdf) [Sweden/Swedish/Svenska](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Sweden.pdf) [Switzerland/Swiss German/Schwiizerdütsch](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Switzerland.pdf) *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Love the upgrades, sky club access which is huge if you ever eat and drink in an airport it can easily be $50 for two if not more in a sit down restaurant/bar.

I build up miles faster with the reserve - I think it's 1/$10 spend vs 1/$20, there are bonus miles added at the beginning of the year to reach status faster. Plus additional miles earned with car and hotel rentals through Delta (though I avoid the vacations), miles with uber, marriott, and some others. You can get presidents circle status through Hertz as a reserve card holder I believe (it may depend on status, can't remember), plus as a platinum status you can pick regional upgrade certificates as your one time annual reward (there are a bunch of other options as well to choose from).

1lsjmnf,n27dhi7,1lsjmnf,1,0.5,comment,,"Technically this isn’t ‘dynamic’ pricing which tends to be related to higher volume transactions. Airlines have used a version of pricing which uses time to flight, remaining seats available, and historic % filled at flight time to adjust prices over months. Looking at the calendar view lets one see when prices bottom out. The no fee change policy allows one to book with confidence earlier then collect the price drops as credits. Good for frequent flyers, not as good for once a year fliers since credits expire. I don’t know if it’s it itinerary dependent but I’ve had cases where it doesn’t allow rebooking the same itinerary for a price drop, I had to change some portion then go back to the original. This is also why booking two one ways can provide more opportunities to harvest price drops. If the outbound increases but the return decreases, rebooking the RT doesn’t save anything. But if you have two OW, you can rebook the leg that dropped without losing the low cost leg.",delta8765,2,,1,2025-07-10 00:46:10,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1lsjmnf/woah_is_this_dynamic_pricing/n27dhi7/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1lsjmnf/woah_is_this_dynamic_pricing/n27dhi7/,,,False,False,False

I'm currently booked on a Delta flight in Comfort Plus from Dayton to Atlanta on 28 December, with a long layover (will spend the night at an airport hotel), then a flight from Atlanta to Paris on 29 December in Premium Select. I paid around $1000 for the one-way ticket that is booked as one ticket from DAY to CDG. Of course, there have been schedule changes. I decided to take a look at the options available. Delta's website is offering me around $750 in eCredit if I...change to the flight to ATL that I'm already booked on. I'm more than a little confused - that has to cancel the ATL to CDG leg, right? There's no way they're offering me the exact same flights for $300 total. Any experts care to weigh in or should I just chat with Delta and ask?

Me and my wife were booked on a new flight for the following day on flight number DL738 departing at 3:10 PM. At the airport, Delta representative confirmed cancellation was due to irregular operations and that Delta is taking responsibility. They sent me a link to book a hotel accomodation for the night and transportation from the airport to the hotel and vice-versa, which I used. They also sent me a $30 meal voucher for both me and my wife. The link to request transportation (Uber) from the hotel to the airport wasn't working (screenshot below), so I had to request one from my own account and paid for it with my own money. For meals, $30 is just isn't enough for 2 people in JFK especially if for those with dietary restrictions. I bough food from my own money for two people (my wife and I) for two meals for a total of $129. I filed a Reimbursement Request with Delta and unfortunately my request got denied.

Would you be able to help us by any chance?"" She looked up and coldly asked, ""With what?"" I was stunned by her coldness and rude behavior. Is this what Delta will allow? After I asked, ""Would you be able to help us get seated together for our upcoming flight?"" She replied, ""I can't do that,"" and simply stared at us, coldly.

1likyi5,1likyi5,,0,0,post,Buying Miles for a Flight,I was looking at buying a couple tickets to London in April. It looks like it's 34k miles + $231 fees. I have 64k miles so I'd have to purchase another 4000 miles for $140. Does this seem reasonable? It doesn't look like tickets will go down much before then so I don't think it makes sense to wait until 12 weeks out. What are people's thoughts?

The $140 for 4000 miles is also pretty awful. *However*, your miles have been sitting for five years, aka you don’t seem to travel/look for award tickets too frequently. Sooo it isn’t actually a horrible idea to do this. You save $478 by using your miles. Again, a “bad” redemption, but since you don’t seem to travel/redeem frequently, that extra $500 probably means more to you for your trip than the “extra” miles you’re spending. TLDR; do it PS - I *think* award tickets can be cancelled, so you can always keep an eye on the prices and potentially cancel/rebook later if prices happen to come down.",WanderlustingTravels,7,,1,2025-06-24 00:56:59,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1likyi5/buying_miles_for_a_flight/mzcx2p3/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1likyi5/buying_miles_for_a_flight/mzcx2p3/,,,False,False,False

1lgbuuh,myv2jrr,1lgbuuh,1,0.0,comment,,"You have two options if you don't know your return date: 1. Book a one-way ticket now, and then but a separate one way ticket when you know your return 2. Book a round trip ticket now, with an estimated return date, and then change the ticket if that date changes It sounds like you want to do option 2. If that's the case once you know the return date you can change the ticket. At that point, Delta will determine what the current price is for you requested new date and you will need to pay the difference (or will receive a credit if it's cheaper). The main difference between Economy and Economy Refundable is whether you get a credit or a refund if you cancel (or change to a cheaper flight). However, it can also affect what fees are charged for flights not originating in the US or Canada. For most flights initially departing from AMS, delta charges a EUR 200.00 change or cancelation fee for each time you make a change to your flight date/times on a Economy ticket; and no fee for Economy Refundable. However, this can vary by route, and since I don't know the detail you should check. To check, go through the process of booking a flight, when you get to the Trip Summary Page (after choosing the flights, but before paying), click on the Changeable/Nonrefundable link just below the trip information; then click Full Fare Rules and open the flights. At the top is a section called Voluntary Changes. You are looking for the following statement which should be the first sentence: * This means no change fee: IN THE EVENT OF CHANGES TO TICKETED FLIGHTS BEFORE DEPARTURE OF JOURNEY - APPLIES WITHIN TKT VALIDITY **NO CHARGE** OR HIGHEST FEE OF ALL CHANGED FARE COMPONENTS. * This means there is a change fee: IN THE EVENT OF CHANGES TO TICKETED FLIGHTS BEFORE DEPARTURE OF JOURNEY - APPLIES WITHIN TKT VALIDITY **CHARGE EUR 200.00** OR HIGHEST FEE OF ALL CHANGED FARE COMPONENTS",ajwright15,7,,1,2025-06-21 03:10:52,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1lgbuuh/which_option_should_i_pick_if_i_want_to_be_able/myv2jrr/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1lgbuuh/which_option_should_i_pick_if_i_want_to_be_able/myv2jrr/,,,False,False,False

[See all of our automod responses here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/15neys0/generating_automated_text_responses_to_common/). --- #Schedule Change Following a schedule change by Delta, you typically have three options: 1. Accept the change 2. Request an alternate routing with Delta 3. Cancel for a credit (or refund in certain circumstances) If you wish to accept the change - you typically do not need to take any action. Delta will not pay for any additional accommodation (e.g., extra hotel nights) for changes made known to you in advance of travel. If you would like to request an alternate routing, Delta will typically rebook you on any available same-day Delta marketed itinerary between the same origin and destination, including alternate connection points, waiving any change fee or fare difference. Delta will typically only allow one free change after a schedule change. You may be able to perform the change online, using the change flight feature. However, if you receive an error or the system attempts to charge you, you will need to call or message Delta. Before calling, the rebooking process will be faster if you already know what alternate flight you want. You can find available options on Delta.com by searching for a new flight just like you would for a new purchase. Write down the flight numbers, and tell them to the agent when you call in. There should generally be no charge for this change; you may have to Hang Up and Call Again (HUCA) if the rep is trying to charge you. If you no longer wish to fly, or prefer to book with another carrier, after a schedule change, you can cancel the flight for an eCredit. If the change meets one of the [refund exception criteria](https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/us/en/news/policy-update-archive/2020/august-2020/delta-updates-its-canadian-and-international-contracts-of-carria.html), you may be eligible for a refund instead of an eCredit: * A delay of 120 minutes or more (on either the arrival or departure time) * A change in the routing of a scheduled Delta flight which adds one or more stops to the original itinerary * A change in equipment from Delta Mainline to Delta Connection carrier * Any change that causes a misconnect If the change meets one or more of the exception criteria, and you wish to cancel your travel for a full refund, you can make the request using the [online cancel and refund form](https://www.delta.com/contactus/iropForm). When submitting the form, in the request description, simply state which of the above criteria applies. You will receive an email response to your request in the timeframe indicated at the top of the form. Please note that Schedule Changes are often loaded into schedules on Saturdays. If your itinerary looks pretty messed up, wait til Monday before looking at it again and see if it needs fixing. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

[See all of our automod responses here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/15neys0/generating_automated_text_responses_to_common/). --- #Compensation Eligibility for compensation is derived from whether or not the delay or flight disruption was within the airline's control. You must request compensation or reimbursement from the operating carrier. The rest of this text assumes that Delta is the operating carrier. Per the US Contract of Carriage, Delta assumes no liability for a *force majeure* as defined: 1. Weather conditions or acts of God; 2. Riots, civil unrest, embargoes, war, hostilities, or unsettled international conditions; 3. Strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockout, or any other labor-related dispute; 4. Government regulation, demand, directive or requirement (inclusive of Air Traffic Control [ATC] initiatives); 5. Shortages of labor, fuel, or facilities; or 6. Any other condition beyond Delta’s control or any fact not reasonably foreseen by Delta As a rule, ""within Delta's control"" or ""reasonably foreseen by Delta"" generally means maintenance delays, crew unavailable (except if caused by weather), and some other reasons that Delta itself could have reasonably prevented. If the flight interruption is within Delta's control, you are entitled to certain accommodations like hotel, ground transportation, meal vouchers, etc during the duration of the flight interruption. Delta usually can provide specific vouchers, but if lines are too long, you can seek your own reasonable accommodation and request reimbursement thru the process outlined below. You are not necessarily entitled to any sort of monetary compensation after the fact, though you can always complain and request cash or miles as a result of the flight interruption. You can visit https://www.delta.com/us/en/need-help/overview -> Refund and Reimbursement Requests (if you are a US or Canadian citizen, if not, use the Comments & Complaints section) to request reimbursement. Delta will reimburse directly related travel expenses like lodging and ground transportation, but they will not reimburse lost wages and other incidentals. If the flight interruption is not in Delta's control, you are not entitled to any accommodation or compensation, though Delta *may* elect to give you some goodwill miles or accommodations. To request compensation after the event, visit https://www.delta.com/us/en/need-help/overview -> Comments & Complaints to initiate the request. **Do not initiate a request for compensation until all legs of your trip are flown! Delta customer service may inadvertently cancel any remaining, unflown legs as a part of your refund/compensation.** For more information, see Rule 19 of the [US Contract of Carriage](https://www.delta.com/us/en/legal/contract-of-carriage-dgr/#19fl) *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1laq2c4,1laq2c4,,0,0,post,"I purchased an extra baggage, Delta made me pay for it again, now refusing to refund","UPDATE: We got a refund through the bank! Thank you so much for all the advice and suggestions, we thought we might have been late to file a claim with the credit card, but it worked!! Woohoo! We have been going through an ordeal for almost two months and I feel we are not being heard. My mom was visiting us in the US, she was about to fly back to Europe on 21/04. When the check-in opened online I purchased an extra checked-in baggage so that she can travel with 2x bags. I received a purchase confirmation right away, the cost of the purchase was $97. There was no indication that there was anything wrong with the purchase. The next day, the day of my mom's flight, we were told at the Atlanta airport that they cannot see my extra bag purchase in the system. I showed them the purchase receipt and the bank transaction information, but the check-in personnel did not seem to care about it. They did not see my purchase in their system, and told us that we have to pay for the bag again. But now the price was $489. For one extra bag for an economy ticket! We immediately contacted the bank, who reassured us that the purchase went through, Delta took my $97. While still at the airport we tried contacting customer service on the phone too, they also could not locate my initial $97 purchase, but still suggested that we pay the $489 and file a claim afterwards. The local personnel was very dismissive and unhelpful, they practically told us to either pay the $489 or step aside. Since time was running out for my mom's flight, we decided to do what the personnel told us to do, paid the $489, so that she can travel with the 2x bags we prepared for. We filed a claim as soon as possible, and the case has been bounced from KLM to Air France to Delta then back to KLM. Nobody has assumed accountability for the issue, and we have been told that the only valid transaction was the $489 that we paid in person. Because that is the transaction that generated an EMD code or whatever, and my original $97 didn't. I fail to see how that is my problem though. This seems to be an error with the system that generates the EMD codes. The transaction of the $97 went through BEFORE we were told to pay the $489, and we also had an official purchase receipt. Nobody seems to care about all the proof, the documents, the receipt, the bank statement. Delta swallowed that money and has been pretending ever since that the $97 never happened. It did. It is on the bank statement that the investigation team is refusing to look at. The investigation team has been telling me like a parrot that my mom's ticket included only one checked-in bag and we presented two at the airport. I KNOW the ticket had 1x included, that's why I requested ANOTHER one a day prior, and I paid for it!! Delta refused to acknowledge that purchase, made us pay again, and swallowed BOTH $97 and the $489 charges. How is that okay??? Also, is a $489 charge for one extra baggage realistic for an economy ticket? Even the local personnel at the check-in kiosk were expressing that they have not seen such a high price for an additional bag. They asked US why was it this expensive! Seriously?! And the ""investigation team"" does not stop to think that hmm this does not add up? Something MUST be wrong here? I do not know where to go from here, we have filed multiple complaints but we have been rejected every time. We did not do anything wrong, Delta has basically stolen money from us. I hoped we could resolve the issue through the proper channels.

(IAD) to Paris on June 6, 2025 was delayed by over 4 hours, causing us to miss the connecting flight from Pari to Bangalore. Air France rebooked us on a new flight for next day * We were sent to a hotel 1.5 miles away, with no shuttle service, requiring my mother and two young children to walk that distance carrying cabin luggage. * We were issued food coupons that were not accepted by any vendors, leaving us to pay out-of-pocket. * Every time we re-entered the airport, we had to go through full security checks, and all food items were confiscated, making it exhausting and frustrating for my family, especially the children. I had prepaid for seat selections ($456 total) on the Air France-operated flight via the Delta website. However, on the day of travel, we were told by Air France that they had received no seat selection information from Delta and randomly assigned seats. As a result, mother and children were seated separately . I had also specifically requested Hindu vegetarian meals, but my family was served random and told we didn't receive any instructions though we choose the food in advance Attempts to reach customer service were equally appalling: * Air France disconnected calls if they couldn’t answer and Delta support wait times exceeded an hr minimum * I even considered canceling our return flight from India to the USA, but was informed there would be no refund.

And expensed it out through travel insurance. - what do you expect airlines to do about full security check when you exit and re-enter airport? “Let these ones in - they were delayed yesterday and therefore couldn’t possibly be a threat”? No, seriously? This sounds like you ranting at this point. You exited the secure area - to enter it back, you have to go through the whole procedure again. Tf do Delta and Airfrance get to do with it? - seat changes happen, but that’s still a valid complaint on your side.

1l5mdu8,mwkjtcw,mwkjtb9,2,0.8.0,comment,,"#EU261 (What can I do/what are my rights during a delayed trip from the EU?) Summoned via `!eu261` --- #EU261 There are passenger rights in the European Union (EU) known as EU261. They provide for cash compensation if you are subject to certain delays and cancellations, subject to terms. Note that this help message is intended to help you request compensation after your flight. If you still need help with your travel, use `!delay` for some tips and tricks. To be eligible for EU261, you must satisfy all of the following conditions: * You are traveling on a flight **departing from** an airport in the EU **OR** you are on an EU-country carrier like Air France or KLM; |Itinerary|Flying an EU carrier|Flying a non-EU carrier |:-:|:-:|:-:| |Flight from the EU to the EU|Eligible|Eligible| |Flight from the EU to non-EU|Eligible|Eligible| |Flight outside of the EU to the EU^1|Eligible|**Ineligible**^1| |Flight outside of the EU to non-EU (e.g. a single ticket JFK-CDG-BOM)|**Ineligible**|**Ineligible**| * ^1 In case of connecting flights covered by a single reservation, if at least one of the connecting flights was operated by a Community air carrier, the connecting flights as a whole should be perceived as operated by a Community air carrier. In other words, JFK-AMS-HAM with Delta operating JFK-AMS and KLM operating AMS-HAM, a delay on the Delta flight would be covered. This claim could be made against the operator of the second flight (KLM), the Community air carrier involved in the performance of the connecting flights, despite them not being the cause of the delay (Delta). * You have a confirmed reservation (includes Basic Economy); * You present yourself for check-in at the time indicated on your Delta ticket receipt or, if no time is indicated, no later than 2 hours before the time of departure; and * You are traveling on a fare available directly or indirectly to the public, or on a ticket issued under a frequent flyer program. #Delays & Cancellation You are **not** eligible for EU261 if you were made aware of the cancellation: * 2 weeks or more before the scheduled time of departure; * between 2 weeks and 7 days before the scheduled time of departure and you were offered re-routing with a departure no more than 2 hours before the scheduled time of departure and an arrival at your final destination less than 4 hours after the scheduled time of arrival; * less than 7 days before the scheduled time of departure and you were offered re-routing with a departure no more than 1 hour before the scheduled time of departure and an arrival at your final destination less than 2 hours after the scheduled time of arrival (If any of these apply, use `!schedulechange` to see your options) Otherwise, you are covered by EU261 if you experience a flight delay or cancellation that is or should have been controllable by the airline. Examples for ""not controllable by the airline"" include weather, ATC delays, strikes, etc. Examples for ""controllable by the airline"" include mechanical delays, airline equipment failure, crew unavailable (not for weather), etc. Here is the table of compensation: |Category|Length of Flight|Credit Voucher Amount|Cash Amount| |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |A|Flights of 1500 km (~932 miles) or less|€350|€250 |B|Flights within the EU of more than 1500 km, and all other flights between 1500 and 3500 km (~2175 miles)|€500|€400| |C|Flights not falling under A or B|€800|€600 \* This compensation may be reduced by 50% if the arrival time of the alternative flight does not exceed the scheduled arrival time of the flight originally booked by: * Category A - 2 hours * Category B - 3 hours * Category C - 4 hours A cancelled/delayed flight from the EU to the US that delayed your arrival at your destination by at least 4 hours would qualify as Category C for €600. #Downgrading If you are involuntarily placed in a lower class than that for which your ticket was purchased, you are entitled to reimbursement within seven days of: |Category|Length of Flight|Reimbursement| |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |A|Flights of 1500 km (~932 miles) or less|30% of the price of the ticket |B|Flights within the EU of more than 1500 km, and all other flights between 1500 and 3500 km (~2175 miles)|50% of the price of the ticket |C|Flights not falling under A or B|75% of the price of the ticket #Denied Boarding When the airline reasonably expects to deny boarding on your flight, the airline will call for volunteers who are prepared to surrender their confirmed reservation for an agreed compensation in Transportation Credit Vouchers. If not enough volunteers can be found and you are denied boarding against your will, you are entitled to denied boarding assistance and compensation **providing you have met the latest check-in time requirements**. You are not entitled to this assistance and compensation if there are reasonable grounds to deny boarding, such as reasons of health, safety, security or inadequate travel documentation. Denied boarding is not generally specifically defined, so if you show up to your gate on time and are not boarded, this may be considered denied boarding. You may choose between: * rerouting to your final destination under comparable transport conditions as soon as possible, or at a later date at your convenience, subject to the availability of seats; or * reimbursement within seven days of your ticket price for the part or parts of the journey that were not made, and for the part or parts already made if the flight no longer serves any useful purpose, taking into consideration the original flight plan, and, when relevant, also a return flight to the first point of departure as noted on the ticket at the earliest opportunity #Compensation You claim compensation with the airline that operated the flight (most likely Delta, Air France, or KLM). For Delta: * To claim compensation, visit https://www.delta.com/us/en/need-help/overview then select Comments & Complaints -> Submit Feedback -> File a Complaint -> Delayed, canceled, and rebooked flights -> Flight delayed/canceled -> and complete the requested information to ensure proper handling of your claim, ensuring that you cite EU261 compensation requirements. For Air France: * To claim compensation, visit https://wwws.airfrance.us/claim -> Log in via your FlyingBlue account or use the specific confirmation code (PNR) For KLM: * To claim compensation, visit https://www.klm.com/claim -> Log in via your FlyingBlue account or use the specific confirmation code (PNR) For more information, visit the EU261 page here - https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm#delay Country and language specific Delta references: [English version for Ireland](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Ireland.pdf) [Denmark/Danish/Dansk](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Denmark.pdf) [France/French/Français](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/France.pdf) / [Air France English version](https://wwws.airfrance.us/information/legal/assistance-et-indemnisation) [Germany/German/Deutsch](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Germany.pdf) [Greece/Greek/Ελληνικά](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Greece.pdf) [Iceland/Icelandic/íslensku](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Iceland.pdf) [Italy/Italian/Italiano](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Italy.pdf) [Netherlands/Dutch/Nederlands](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Netherlands.pdf) / [KLM English version](https://www.klm.com/information/legal/assistance-compensation) [Spain/Spanish/Español](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Spain.pdf) [Sweden/Swedish/Svenska](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Sweden.pdf) [Switzerland/Swiss German/Schwiizerdütsch](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Switzerland.pdf) *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even though DL’s international routes are largely influenced by business demand, there’s a booming tech industry in the pacific NW that could benefit from a direct flight. Although there’s competition with the ME3, surely some leisure travelers will prefer a direct over needing to connect in DXB or DOH. It also gives them an edge over AS/HA and their international expansion, as AS’s CEO has said that they are aiming for 12 international routes by 2030.

About 10 minutes after I dropped her off at the airport, she called me in a panic. Right after clearing security, a woman tripped and fell onto her carry-on and bent the telescopic handle. At the gate, she was eventually able to get the handle back down at the gate with a lot of effort. Not the greatest start to her trip since this is her only bag. She has 4.5 hours at JFK T4 (lands in about three hours). Are there any stores inside T4 that perhaps can help troubleshoot the handle or, worst-case scenario, buy a new carry-on? The good thing is that if the bag survives the trans-Atlantic portion of the trip, she will be able to borrow a carry-on from her relatives. *Edited to add:* Thanks for everyone's input.

Customer service’s Jessica Wilkinson later blamed unspecified “operational circumstances” and “unforeseen factors.” She refused to say what they were, what my rights were or otherwise explain the surprise change, beyond the vague euphemisms. Flight attendants gave me 4,000 miles; Delta 2,000 more. Not enough, as I see it, for a highly uncomfortable sleepless night prior to an important trip. I’d had the bulkhead seat assignment for three months.

Now, what you potentially could do if you live near the airport that you opened your damage claim. Show up in person, ask for a red coat, very calmly explain you've been working to resolve your grievance for some time, give them the claim number, explain that you're still not satisfied and ask if they can give you some ""sky pesos.""

1keixkp,1keixkp,,0,0,post,Some general questions,"Hi everyone, I'm flying soon and have some questions about the check-in process. This is my first time booking directly with the airline instead of using a third-party service. I have two pieces of luggage: one to check in and one carry-on. During online check-in, I noticed an option to select baggage(baggage - 0 +). Does this refer only to checked baggage, or does it include carry-on luggage as well? I'm unsure whether I need to indicate my carry-on during online check-in. My itinerary is from JFK to Seattle, then onward to China. Will my checked baggage be automatically transferred from JFK to my final destination, or will I need to collect it in Seattle and check it in again? Apologies if my questions are a bit unclear—I'm new to this process.

They both will charge for the checked bag and both will offer similar style seats. Delta’s plane interiors are slightly better, as are the employee uniforms.

It’s also amusing to watch your flight path on screen or in the app. AND you don’t have to check in 24hrs in advance for your boarding number.,Upstairs_Role_7602,4,,1,2025-04-19 12:00:03,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1k2kgin/help_a_gal_out_first_time_flying_delta/mnvixfa/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1k2kgin/help_a_gal_out_first_time_flying_delta/mnvixfa/,,,False,False,False

1k2s40e,mnwudsx,1k2s40e,1,0.0,comment,,"Thanks for sharing, and first off, major respect for still getting out there and traveling. The Embraer 175 is actually one of the more comfortable regional jets out there, and since you're in the first row of First Class, you’re in one of the best spots on the plane. Legroom is solid, overhead space is better than most regional jets, and the one two seating layout means more privacy and easier aisle access, especially important when mobility is limited. From a wheelchair user's perspective, you've already done the most important part by making sure your solid frame chair is pre-arranged for storage. That is key, since the Embraer 175’s cargo door is often wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs without disassembly, unlike some smaller regional jets. Since you're a Delta Sky Priority member, ground crews tend to be a bit more attentive and responsive, especially when it comes to boarding and deplaning assistance. Boarding is usually through a jet bridge at BOS, so you should avoid stairs, and the cabin crew on Delta’s regional partners are generally kind and helpful, especially with preboarding and in flight needs. Just be sure to reconfirm with the gate agent before boarding that the chair is being handled properly. Most mishaps come from lack of communication between gate and ramp staff. Also, since it is a quick hop, you likely won’t need to use the lavatory, but be aware that the Embraer 175 lavatory is not wheelchair accessible. It is actually very tight for everyone, really.

1k1t02y,mnrteqh,1k1t02y,1,0.2,comment,,"I have two competing comments having been in a similar situation in the past with United and Lufthansa. I went Lufthansa because they had business class lounge access for their silver membership. Their silver membership use to be harder to obtain (35k miles vs. 25k miles), but the status would last 2 years each time. I racked up about 250k miles on that account. The client I had started using other airlines, so the account went stagnant and it was hard for me to keep open. I now work out of a United account and have about 180k miles on that account. For my current day use, United makes much more sense. Here is the kicker… I can’t help but think that my million miler status track with United could be 430k vs. 180k right now. What makes sense for now using a foreign air carrier account, might not make sense in the long run… so consider long term million miler calculations, especially when long haul travel is involved. Now the other side of the coin. Delta has taken perks away from gold+ skymiles members that Skyteam elite members get. It’s because the ranks of people with status with Delta is bloated (large thanks to delta’s popular credit cards). The first big thing is delta doesn’t give sky club access to gold+ membership use on international flights anymore, but Skyteam elite plus members do get access via Skyteam contract rules. So if you gain status using a SAS (or more commonly a AF/KLM flying blue account), you can get more perks from delta when traveling international. But I would envision a future 10 years from now where you’re no longer flying SAS and your new job has you flying domestic and you end up using delta. Do you want 500k towards your million miler by that time? Or want to start over from scratch or keep using a SAS account. I would give an edge to Delta, simply because your distant future is more likely to have you in a life circumstance using delta more and it’s worth putting all those long haul flights toward delta million miler status.",cwdawg15,1,,1,2025-04-18 23:21:15,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1k1t02y/join_sas_or_delta_loyalty_program/mnrteqh/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1k1t02y/join_sas_or_delta_loyalty_program/mnrteqh/,,,False,False,False

1jm1ig5,1jm1ig5,,0,0,post,WHY I DONT FLY  DELTA AIRLINES,"With Delta Airlines, booking and paying for a fare is not a guarantee that the delta will meet it's engagement. You have obligations - they don't. They just take your money and might deliver the service you paid for ??!! The company will change your itinerary, time of your flight or even date, and ask you to reach out to them to either make a free change or cancel your booking without a fee. HOWEVER, when you try to rebook ... there is never anything available, regardless of all combinations you try. AND SURPRISE, surprise when you try to cancel the fare all together, the MAJOR change to your ticket they reached to you about is now VERY MINOR and prevents you to do so. No amount of reminding them their engagements or pointing out to the ridiculousness of the situation will result in a solution. Missing your connecting flight is so minor... why even mention. I boycotted them for years and made the mistake to try again.

[See all of our automod responses here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/15neys0/generating_automated_text_responses_to_common/). --- #Schedule Change Following a schedule change by Delta, you typically have three options: 1. Accept the change 2. Request an alternate routing with Delta 3. Cancel for a credit (or refund in certain circumstances) If you wish to accept the change - you typically do not need to take any action. Delta will not pay for any additional accommodation (e.g., extra hotel nights) for changes made known to you in advance of travel. If you would like to request an alternate routing, Delta will typically rebook you on any available same-day Delta marketed itinerary between the same origin and destination, including alternate connection points, waiving any change fee or fare difference. Delta will typically only allow one free change after a schedule change. You may be able to perform the change online, using the change flight feature. However, if you receive an error or the system attempts to charge you, you will need to call or message Delta. Before calling, the rebooking process will be faster if you already know what alternate flight you want. You can find available options on Delta.com by searching for a new flight just like you would for a new purchase. Write down the flight numbers, and tell them to the agent when you call in. There should generally be no charge for this change; you may have to Hang Up and Call Again (HUCA) if the rep is trying to charge you. If you no longer wish to fly, or prefer to book with another carrier, after a schedule change, you can cancel the flight for an eCredit. If the change meets one of the [refund exception criteria](https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/us/en/news/policy-update-archive/2020/august-2020/delta-updates-its-canadian-and-international-contracts-of-carria.html), you may be eligible for a refund instead of an eCredit: * A delay of 120 minutes or more (on either the arrival or departure time) * A change in the routing of a scheduled Delta flight which adds one or more stops to the original itinerary * A change in equipment from Delta Mainline to Delta Connection carrier * Any change that causes a misconnect If the change meets one or more of the exception criteria, and you wish to cancel your travel for a full refund, you can make the request using the [online cancel and refund form](https://www.delta.com/contactus/iropForm). When submitting the form, in the request description, simply state which of the above criteria applies. You will receive an email response to your request in the timeframe indicated at the top of the form. Please note that Schedule Changes are often loaded into schedules on Saturdays. If your itinerary looks pretty messed up, wait til Monday before looking at it again and see if it needs fixing. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1jl4amp,1jl4amp,,0,0,post,Flight Attendants' LOUD Conversations Across Galley On Red-Eye Flights,"So I don't fly constantly, but I do travel quite a bit from JFK to various places in South America, so the flights each way tend to be red-eye flights. I pay extra for the slightly wider seats forward of regular coach seats, so my wife and I tend to be within a few rows of the galley. I understand that the flight attendants can't sit next to each other, and that their seats are on oppsite sides of the airframe, but the loud conversations that result provide me with far too much information about the personal lives of the flight attendants than anyone would desire, and make it that much harder to get some sleep, as they are clearly wired up on caffeine so that they do not fall asleep while on the job. I do not like ear buds or headphones for extended periods, so noise-cancelling head gear is not a good suggestion. The nice and purportedly noise-cancelling headphones provided in the little armrest cubby between the seats are not noise-cancelling enough to block the nasal, high-pitched, loud discussion of personal matters I will not recite here. But how to ask a flight attendant to ""pipe down"" without being viewed as a threat to the safety of the aircraft? One has to consider the retaliation possibilities these days.

Or try a hospital bed next to the breakroom. A constant flow of people getting in, getting out, and at the door the huddles are forming, because the breakroom door is the narrowest part. They can't shut up, the hospital staff cannot understand that it's a hospital and many people have serious health issues and need quietness (it was in the middle of COVID), it all doesn't matter to them. I never knew that in my pain I'd have to listen to how hospital staff makes tartas at home, how not to make tartas, and why the Lakers suck.

1jjobq8,1jjobq8,,0,0,post,Airline seat fairness... what exactly are we paying for?,"Question I know this has probably been posted before, but I just got back from a business trip and I am seriously frustrated. I’m not a small person, but I fit within the limits of a single seat. On both flights, each over three hours, I was stuck in the middle seat between two people who could have easily filled two seats each. It honestly felt like five people were packed into the space meant for three. There was constant, unavoidable body contact, and I literally had to buy a new change of clothes when I landed because mine were soaked with sweat from being pressed against these two people the entire time. I know it’s not entirely their fault, but isn’t that kind of physical encroachment something we should be talking about? Isn't it technically a crime to touch someone who doesn’t want to be touched? We all paid for one seat, but I only got maybe 60 percent of mine, at most. Why is it my responsibility to buy a first-class ticket or book two seats just to avoid having my space taken from me? Specifically, can someone from the industry explain the travel terms of service... or whatever it’s officially called? What am I actually buying when I pay for a seat on an airline? I've also heard they won't let you book an extra seat to keep empty, they'll fill it anyway with a standby, is that true? I’m not trying to be cruel. I’m asking honestly: how is this fair? What are we supposed to do? Just suck it up? (No pun intended.) (FYI- this EXACT post was removed and got me perma-banned on the r/travel ...this just happened on Delta flights.

I was here first in the seats ahead of you, so why should I be the one who has to leave the flight instead of the complainer? plus I miss my flight and then what? Even if I rebook my flight and get another one later in the day, what are the 50/50 chances the same thing that happened on the first flight doesn’t happen again? Even if I did pay for a second seat to avoid it for the next list of reasons why I said it’s not my problem. or what I said about even if the overweight person DOES buy a ‘second’ seat just so they can have the extra space so they don’t have to deal with people complaining about encroaching on their space, and then the airline decides to take the seat from them for some reason, with the seat being listed as ‘unclaimed’ because it is empty, and they need another seat for a passenger (who turns out to be the complainer) who doesn’t have a seat at all on the plane until they have the second to them instead. or what if you bought a second seat for yourself in a certain part of the plane, and for some reason before the flight the airline decides to move you from your chosen seat(s) to another spot in the plane, and you wind up losing your second seat THAT way because your new location on the plane doesn’t come with two seats together? So somewhere on the plane, your second seat remains empty during the flight unless the airline lets another passenger has it, and your back to square one of somebody complaining about you taking up their space in the seats and trying to get YOU kicked off because of the airlines mistakes. i’ve even read stories where somebody who wasn’t overweight/size who bought a second seat just to make sure they don’t have to deal with anybody sitting next to them, and was just SLIGHTLY overweight but wasn’t FULLY big enough for their body to be taking up space in both seats when sitting down, say that the airline would revoke the seat from them because they don’t look ‘fat enough’ to be needing that extra seat they paid for, when they have another passenger who needs a seat and the first persons extra empty seat was the only one left that didn’t have somebody sitting in it, so they revoke the first passengers claim to the seat and mark it as unclaimed because nobody was sitting in it by the time boarding was almost finished, and print out a ticket for the new person to have a claim to the seat instead. whats the point of paying and wasting money on a second seat for yourself if half the time the airline might take it away from you for reasons like letting another passenger, who for some reason didn’t have a seat at all on the plane before boarding, have it instead of you even though you were the one who paid for it?",river_song25,0,,7,2025-03-29 05:32:17,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1jjobq8/airline_seat_fairness_what_exactly_are_we_paying/mk9833n/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1jjobq8/airline_seat_fairness_what_exactly_are_we_paying/mk9833n/,,,False,False,False

Granted there are a very few people who suffer from this condition but honestly, most people that are obese suffer from lack of push-away…..Push away from the table!

If I weighed 385, I'm much more expensive to transport to an airline, especially when multiplied x100. We know seats won't get smaller, so the only viable solution would to have some max weight limit and then charge above that. If you weigh less, then you get a discount. It'll never happen because someone would get their feelings hurt, but those who disagree should be required to sit next to these extra large individuals on every flight. In all seriousness, we've all been in this situation before and it's hugely uncomfortable to confront someone impeding on your space you paid for. One would hope an individual knows the issue and makes improvements to fit better, but they won't. The only thing more frustrating is seeing someone bring in two legit suitcases and put them in overhead bins and tie up all the space for others.

I am a big guy, not so big that I can’t keep myself contained to my seat but it can be rather uncomfortable doing so. I had purchased a dirt cheap first class seat from Boston to LAX on Delta but unfortunately a similar fare was not available on the way home. Instead I booked 2 seats on JetBlue in the extra space cabin because 6 hours of sitting with my arms crossed and shoulders scrunched was too much to bear. I had both boarding passes and scanned them both. It was fine until about 20 minutes into the flight when the FA moved a woman from the back of the plane to the front. She told the woman to sit in my extra seat and when I told the FA I had paid for that empty seat she just shrugged and said “well, her TV isn’t working so she is going to sit here. Request a refund when we land”. I was pissed. I refused to scrunch myself up to accommodate this woman because her god damn TV wasn’t working. Even sitting normally I barely encroach another seat. She was pissed and kept elbowing me the entire flight and taking deep breaths. I pretended I didn’t notice and kept looking out the window. When we landed I went straight to JetBlue customer service and they said they would verify my story with the FA on board. After a few weeks I called and asked where my refund was. They told me I wasn’t eligible since the flight left the gate with that seat empty and they can’t just go based on my word.

Especially since there are options to not fly, take a train, drive, buy two seats, or first class. Airlines historically are a bad investment and not a path to riches. Tickets have gotten much less costly over the years because that is what customers demand. But in the end, we are freight and it stands to reason that a 400 lb person should not be paying the same as a 100 lb person, yet that is the expectation because the rest of us have allowed this to take place. The focus should be on what people control, which is what seats they buy, and put it on each passenger to never request or impose their bodies for whatever reason, on others who have not consented.

That program ensures your 2nd seat is adjacent to you even if equipment changes, and refunds the second fare if the plane is not sold out. Another option is to fly in the exit row or bulkhead row. In the former, seatbelt extenders are banned by the FAA, while in the latter, the tray table is usually in the armrest, creating a wall between your seat and your seat mate's lower abdomen.

When asking them about it they said its fine. I politely disagreed, quickly took a photo and returned to my seat. Few minutes later two cabin attendants came to my seat and asked me if I had taken a picture of the plane door, and that this was a forbidden activity. I played dumb and told them I have no idea what they are talking about. They looked at each other and discussed if it was really me that they were talking to... I've shared the story with Delta's customer service which didn't really care about the issue of the cabin attendants threatening me. Who knows what they would have done if I had say ""yes, I took a picture of your stuff on the door""? At least Delta confirmed that absolutely nothing should be on the doors as even the most minor things can delay an emergency deplaning...

If they do get moved due to aircraft changes later on, we can see this when going through our unseated lists. But anyways. We board You the passenger then call our 1-800 number, who marks the ticket as ""used"" so we can't sell the seat or give it to a standby passenger. Once the segment is flown that's when the credit activates. This all also applies to things like Cellos, large musical instruments, and very rarely but not common larger service dogs that take up too much floor space.

1jirtbc,mjv3a3f,1jirtbc,1,0.32,comment,,You’re good! I fly all the time with 2 seats and an extender. Some tips: 1. Make sure you check in BOTH boarding passes with the gate agent. Both need to be scanned. 2. I usually tell the FA as I am boarding that I have 2 seats. This prevents confusion if they know it’s a full flight and are visually looking to see if there are empty seats. 3. You’ll need to ask the FA for the seatbelt extender. I prefer to do this as I board as it’s hard to flag someone down once you’re down the aisle. Typically they’ll ask me where I’m sitting and bring it down once boarding is complete. They typically default to being discreet for those who may be embarrassed. (I don’t particularly care lol. You can see that I’m fat by looking at me.) 4. You’ll likely still be a little uncomfortable even with 2 seats but you won’t be encroaching on anyone. 5. I flew at 375 and had no issue with the seatbelt extender fitting. You’ll be fine.

Last, for me, this is the first trip like this I am able to do in 15 years. I have lost at least 2 days of a week trip. I work in community mental health, which has taken such a beating since COVID. A lot of people left the field, and unlike the COVID cases, the lingering mental issues did not go away. To say I need a break is an understatement. Delta offers absolutely nothing accept an AI generated apology. What can I do to get some accountability? ETA: I’m not just looking for compensation for me. I’m appalled by how they treated the wheelchair passengers. That’s why I put it first. The woman I helped would otherwise have had to be incompetent or risk falling since she only could stagger a few steps. I worked in a group home for people with traumatic brain injury, most of whom had to use wheelchairs. That could be any of us tomorrow. We would all want to be treated with dignity. They need better contingencies if there is a significant delay for their passengers in wheelchairs. Also, that is way too many mechanical problems. I have flown hundreds of legs of flights. I don’t think I’ve had more than 10 significant delays/cancellations from mechanical issues. My father is a retired airline pilot and he was alarmed when I told him. This is the type of thing that would be a pattern in hindsight after some catastrophic incident. Delta’s CEO was enthusiastic that Trump was elected because it meant less regulation. Those regulations are there for a reason. If they are compromising safety with poor maintenance, the time to address it is now",ConsequenceThin383,0,0.37,12,2025-03-24 13:21:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1jijgq7/best_way_to_hold_delta_accountable/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1jijgq7/best_way_to_hold_delta_accountable/,False,True,False,False,False

I also don’t agree with it. But unfortunately (at least in the US) there is no corporate accountability and any actual care about the customer is rare. That created an entire different industry thriving on it, which gave a viable shift of responsibility from the airline to the insurance, which made those corporations even worse in those fields.

Summoned via `!eu261` --- #EU261 There are passenger rights in the European Union (EU) known as EU261. They provide for cash compensation if you are subject to certain delays and cancellations, subject to terms. Note that this help message is intended to help you request compensation after your flight. If you still need help with your travel, use `!delay` for some tips and tricks. To be eligible for EU261, you must satisfy all of the following conditions: * You are traveling on a flight **departing from** an airport in the EU **OR** you are on an EU-country carrier like Air France or KLM; |Itinerary|Flying an EU carrier|Flying a non-EU carrier |:-:|:-:|:-:| |Flight from the EU to the EU|Eligible|Eligible| |Flight from the EU to non-EU|Eligible|Eligible| |Flight outside of the EU to the EU^1|Eligible|**Ineligible**^1| |Flight outside of the EU to non-EU (e.g. a single ticket JFK-CDG-BOM)|**Ineligible**|**Ineligible**| * ^1 In case of connecting flights covered by a single reservation, if at least one of the connecting flights was operated by a Community air carrier, the connecting flights as a whole should be perceived as operated by a Community air carrier. In other words, JFK-AMS-HAM with Delta operating JFK-AMS and KLM operating AMS-HAM, a delay on the Delta flight would be covered. This claim could be made against the operator of the second flight (KLM), the Community air carrier involved in the performance of the connecting flights, despite them not being the cause of the delay (Delta). * You have a confirmed reservation (includes Basic Economy); * You present yourself for check-in at the time indicated on your Delta ticket receipt or, if no time is indicated, no later than 2 hours before the time of departure; and * You are traveling on a fare available directly or indirectly to the public, or on a ticket issued under a frequent flyer program. #Delays & Cancellation You are **not** eligible for EU261 if you were made aware of the cancellation: * 2 weeks or more before the scheduled time of departure; * between 2 weeks and 7 days before the scheduled time of departure and you were offered re-routing with a departure no more than 2 hours before the scheduled time of departure and an arrival at your final destination less than 4 hours after the scheduled time of arrival; * less than 7 days before the scheduled time of departure and you were offered re-routing with a departure no more than 1 hour before the scheduled time of departure and an arrival at your final destination less than 2 hours after the scheduled time of arrival (If any of these apply, use `!schedulechange` to see your options) Otherwise, you are covered by EU261 if you experience a flight delay or cancellation that is or should have been controllable by the airline. Examples for ""not controllable by the airline"" include weather, ATC delays, strikes, etc. Examples for ""controllable by the airline"" include mechanical delays, airline equipment failure, crew unavailable (not for weather), etc. Here is the table of compensation: |Category|Length of Flight|Credit Voucher Amount|Cash Amount| |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |A|Flights of 1500 km (~932 miles) or less|€350|€250 |B|Flights within the EU of more than 1500 km, and all other flights between 1500 and 3500 km (~2175 miles)|€500|€400| |C|Flights not falling under A or B|€800|€600 \* This compensation may be reduced by 50% if the arrival time of the alternative flight does not exceed the scheduled arrival time of the flight originally booked by: * Category A - 2 hours * Category B - 3 hours * Category C - 4 hours A cancelled/delayed flight from the EU to the US that delayed your arrival at your destination by at least 4 hours would qualify as Category C for €600. #Downgrading If you are involuntarily placed in a lower class than that for which your ticket was purchased, you are entitled to reimbursement within seven days of: |Category|Length of Flight|Reimbursement| |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| |A|Flights of 1500 km (~932 miles) or less|30% of the price of the ticket |B|Flights within the EU of more than 1500 km, and all other flights between 1500 and 3500 km (~2175 miles)|50% of the price of the ticket |C|Flights not falling under A or B|75% of the price of the ticket #Denied Boarding When the airline reasonably expects to deny boarding on your flight, the airline will call for volunteers who are prepared to surrender their confirmed reservation for an agreed compensation in Transportation Credit Vouchers. If not enough volunteers can be found and you are denied boarding against your will, you are entitled to denied boarding assistance and compensation **providing you have met the latest check-in time requirements**. You are not entitled to this assistance and compensation if there are reasonable grounds to deny boarding, such as reasons of health, safety, security or inadequate travel documentation. Denied boarding is not generally specifically defined, so if you show up to your gate on time and are not boarded, this may be considered denied boarding. You may choose between: * rerouting to your final destination under comparable transport conditions as soon as possible, or at a later date at your convenience, subject to the availability of seats; or * reimbursement within seven days of your ticket price for the part or parts of the journey that were not made, and for the part or parts already made if the flight no longer serves any useful purpose, taking into consideration the original flight plan, and, when relevant, also a return flight to the first point of departure as noted on the ticket at the earliest opportunity #Compensation You claim compensation with the airline that operated the flight (most likely Delta, Air France, or KLM). For Delta: * To claim compensation, visit https://www.delta.com/us/en/need-help/overview then select Comments & Complaints -> Submit Feedback -> File a Complaint -> Delayed, canceled, and rebooked flights -> Flight delayed/canceled -> and complete the requested information to ensure proper handling of your claim, ensuring that you cite EU261 compensation requirements. For Air France: * To claim compensation, visit https://wwws.airfrance.us/claim -> Log in via your FlyingBlue account or use the specific confirmation code (PNR) For KLM: * To claim compensation, visit https://www.klm.com/claim -> Log in via your FlyingBlue account or use the specific confirmation code (PNR) For more information, visit the EU261 page here - https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm#delay Country and language specific Delta references: [English version for Ireland](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Ireland.pdf) [Denmark/Danish/Dansk](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Denmark.pdf) [France/French/Français](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/France.pdf) / [Air France English version](https://wwws.airfrance.us/information/legal/assistance-et-indemnisation) [Germany/German/Deutsch](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Germany.pdf) [Greece/Greek/Ελληνικά](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Greece.pdf) [Iceland/Icelandic/íslensku](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Iceland.pdf) [Italy/Italian/Italiano](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Italy.pdf) [Netherlands/Dutch/Nederlands](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Netherlands.pdf) / [KLM English version](https://www.klm.com/information/legal/assistance-compensation) [Spain/Spanish/Español](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Spain.pdf) [Sweden/Swedish/Svenska](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Sweden.pdf) [Switzerland/Swiss German/Schwiizerdütsch](https://www.delta.com/content/dam/delta-www/pdfs/eu-compensation/Switzerland.pdf) *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1jdvxnz,mk2xq74,mk2rjxu,3,0.2.0.0,comment,,"So I'll start by saying DEI has nothing to do with it. So some aircraft are more prone to it than others. An easy comparison is a 737 with or without the reverse scimitar (downward facing) winglets. I wouldn't be surprised if nationwide in the US a few of those get scraped a year. Likewise the CRJ series has fairly low mounted wings and narrow gear so less of a bank will cause a close proximity. This is mainly an issue with strong cross winds as the ""standard"" technique for crosswind landings usually involves dipping the upwind wing down towards the ground to ""slip"" so that the actual aircraft is pointed straight down the runway even though it is now flying a bit sideways through the air. Low wings require more attention or in the case of the 737 many times different landing techniques. It can be easy for a pilot with many years flying aircraft where this isn't an issue to get a wing a bit too close. Likewise a strong gust down low can cause a wing to lift and the other to get lower and require fast responses to mitigate. Now, this isn't to say that this isn't internally considered a relatively big deal, but this is a big deal in the realm of most areas of aircraft damage and not normal national headlines or even local news articles. Normally even pilots outside of the company and many company pilots wouldn't even know about it unless it reflected a trend that necessitated a change in training or new training scenario.",SubarcticFarmer,1,,1,2025-03-28 05:57:23,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1jdvxnz/wing_of_delta_plane_strikes_runway_during_landing/mk2xq74/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1jdvxnz/wing_of_delta_plane_strikes_runway_during_landing/mk2xq74/,,,False,False,False

Occams razor. 2 months ago delta brags about their dei programs, then theres a crash with a female pilot in toronto and then we have this incident with another female pilot. I just watched a video with a 30 year veteran pilot, who said only twice in his flying career had he had to take over the plane in similar fashion to what happened here. He also mentioned, both times it was when he was training another pilot, never during a commercial flight. We can include that helicopter crash as well, which makes 3 incidents with female pilots in a couple months that may have got to their position from dei. But really we dont know enough about that helicopter one yet. Female pilots make up 5% of pilots. The odds are astronomical, unless you consider dei a factor, or just poor hiring practices in general. Most commercial pilots up until recently have been obsessed with planes their whole lives, they've gone thru the military route or years in Cessna's and flying cargo planes in the middle of nowhere. My friend used to play a flight simulator and half the people on there were pilots. Thats how much they love flying. Now because of dei programs you arent getting cream of the crop people who have made flying the love of their lives. These programs especially hurt women and pilots of color who actually did become pilots because of merit and flying being their lifelong dream that they worked their asses off for.

1je6rpy,mijskb8,1je6rpy,1,0.6,comment,,"Agree with the AirTrain doctrine unless you’ve got enough people that a cab makes sense (or you’re so bougie to get a helicopter transfer). That said, you don’t have *that* much time in Manhattan if you’re flying to JFK. Figure an hour each way to Manhattan, and you’ll want to plan for dinner at the airport to avoid surprises. Consider one or two things tops. Southern part of Central Park down to Grand Central and Rockefeller Center is a solid combo if the weather is nice. Good bus options if you want the boost, and Top of the Rock is a magnificent observation deck if heights are your jam. Bad weather but a lot of time? Try the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the MoMA. Both are winners, just comes down to taste. (You’ll notice I omitted Times Square here. I wouldn’t burn that much time there as it’s hilariously overtouristed even by NYC standards.) If you need to stay closer in due to flight changes, try the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Gorgeous even in the dead of winter. Or take the A train down to the Rockaways and get a bit of beach. Or maybe the Mets are playing a day game. If your layover is totally blown or the weather is that bad, try the TWA Hotel on the JFK campus. It’s pretty, you can experience New York prices on a snack and drinks, and if it all goes to hell they have rooms. Usually, your bags get checked through—they were on my long layover at JFK a couple years back. Verify that at LAS. Baggage storage is available, or shoot your shot with the Delta counter at JFK if they deliver it there. Do you have TSA Precheck? It’ll be helpful at JFK coming back. Security is a bit of a zoo.

1jco6m9,1jco6m9,,0,0,post,Delta reserve card sky lounge question,"Hi everyone, I got the delta reserve Amex card - the purple one - bc getting stranded at layovers with my 4 and 5 year old gets rough. One has a genetic disorder and it's not horrible but stuff adds up. Anyway I thought the card would cover my family for the lounge from everything I read. I went today for the first time in Atlanta and they said I would have to use the guest vouchers for my kids and for my husband it would be 50 dollars. I thought I only got a few guest vouchers a year but my kids would be included at least when I go in. Not that it mattered...I went right when they stopped all the food to transition from one meal to another. Anyway I'm not trying to complain or sound entitled - i just want to make sure i understand and it wasn't a fluke. The 15 visits a year only covers me, I can only bring my kids once bc we get two guest vouchers a year and if my husband comes he has to pay 50 dollars? I appreciate any info you guys have. Nothing has gone smoothly today, I know it happens with traveling but I was hoping any of you would know this without me having to speak to another customer service rep. If not tho, that's OK.

The advice of talking to Delta first before you get a lawyer seems reasonable, but remember that the claims handler at Delta has got far more experience in this type of thing than the average person. To deal with Delta you’ve got to talk to them. That’s dangerous for your claim. For example, if the claims handler returns your call and begins with the pleasantry “hello u/STANIF83’s husband, how are you”?, and you respond “good, you?” he or she is going to make a note in the file “admitted he is “good”. And referred back to that every time you speak in the future. You don’t know how much harm you can do. I’m much more effective when I’m hired to fix a problem caused by some big corporation than if I’m hired to fix a problem my client has cause during the claim handling process.

This can often mean you get less than the reasonable value of your damages should you handle it yourself. If Delta jacks you around & doesn’t want to pay anything, just get a reputable attorney. If they want to offer your bills+inconvenience/pain+miles, talk to them & try to work it out. Not like you did anything to cause possible injury as in a car wreck, so why is the attorney in here saying you need to be careful what you say to insurance adjusters- how could the simple act of sitting on a plane show you were negligent and contribute to your possible injury?

It is often only AFTER a lawyer is involved that an injured party is taken seriously. If you can, seek out lawyers who have previous experience with airlines as it's a bit different than car accidents, for example. That may take a bit of calling around, but ask for referrals from reputable lawyers in your area. It's best to do so quickly. Imaging and exams should be done as soon as possible after the injury (especially with delicate areas like the eyes), to prevent future damage. Don't be afraid to ask for second opinions if you have doubts. Also, ask your husband to write down his account of events, even if it's just in an email draft to himself. Sometimes detailed memories will surface later, but it's better to write down what you can immediately so it isn't forgotten. (If his eyes are in pain, he can dictate his experience using voice notes) It's possible Delta will offer you a sum upfront for your troubles, but it's unlikely to cover your medical expenses off the bat.

I currently have gold medallion status ( not sure if that’s relevant or not), and I always buy first class tickets right from the start. But the price on one FC ticket for this less than 3 hr flight is more than $1100. Here’s my question: If I buy Main Cabin ticket, when I go to pay for the ticket in the delta app, will it give me an offer to pay for an upgrade to first class? Or does that offer not happen until shortly before your departure date? Or is that not even a guarantee that I’ll get an offer to pay for an upgrade? I don’t want to risk things by waiting to get a complimentary upgrade because those are very few and far between. I’ve never bought a main cabin ticket before and I’m worried that we will be stuck in seats my spouse won’t be comfy in. The C+ ticket is only slightly less than FC but again, my spouse is a big guy - like football player size — and that’s why I’ve always just sucked it up and paid for FC right from the start rather than hope for a free upgrade or hope to get a “you can upgrade for an additional $200”.

What puzzles me is how you simultaneously find that the gate agent “was doing an incredible job policing them” while also claiming 20+ made it through. So I asked: how? Even if they just boldly lied about being disabled, how did they get away with bringing more than their carryon allowance without the agent checking bags at the gate? I’ll offer another perspective, to make clear why I think people should reserve judgement. I employ somebody who fits your description as a “young adult.” He has an autism spectrum disorder. Twice a year, he goes on a vacation with a small group. He gets super nervous about flying, just navigating the airport puts him in sensory overload. You would not be able to tell by looking at him. He preboards, as is his right. A few years ago he had his vacation ruined by a judgemental elderly man who found him on the plane just to berate him about abusing preboarding. Now the thought of going skiing (which he loves) makes him nervous because he has to fly. I’m not saying this applies to the people on your flight. I am saying: this instance of snap judgment on my employee was 100 times more impactful on his life than any annoyance on the part of the other passengers might be. Also, you’re not doing your own blood pressure any favors. The gate lice? Your life is better than theirs. Shrug. Board at your leisure.

1j2wekv,1j2wekv,,0,0,post,Info regarding compensation for flight cancellation,"Hi guys, I need input and info with regards to a canceled flight I had with Delta in late January. So the story is, me and my friend had a flight from JFK to MCO and our flight from JFK got canceled due to a snow storm. I was refunded my ticket cost by Delta, but I had a lot of extra expenses because of this cancellation. I had to purchase a last minute $600 ticket on JetBlue and arrived without my bags as Delta said it would take hours to get it, and I had a cruise to catch out of Cape Canaveral. So we went ahead without our bags and had to buy EVERYTHING from scratch. We just had back packs. We eventually collected our bags at the end of our cruise. But the thing is, I wholly blame Delta for all of this, and not the weather. You see at the time, most flights were canceled, only a couple including ours were still scheduled but VERY delayed. Our airplane that originally was supposed to take us was diverted to another airport and yet Delta still did not cancel the flight, after hours of delays we were scheduled to board at 11:42 instead of our 6:45 original time. When we boarded they forced us to hand over our trolley bags, and after waiting 2.5 hours in the aircraft they decided to cancel the flight due to their staffing hours as de-icing crew weren’t coming, it later took them 1.5 hours to get us out and by that time it was already past 3am. They did not have a flight that would take me to Orlando that would enable me to catch my cruise. Anyway, they are blaming the weather solely for this and based on that they do not want to reimburse my JetBlue ticket or other expenses. Question is, can my case be the blame of the airline in any way? We have like close to $1k of extra expenses as we had to buy everything from the cruise.",therealKingOwner,0,0.14,11,2025-03-04 07:13:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1j2wekv/info_regarding_compensation_for_flight/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1j2wekv/info_regarding_compensation_for_flight/,False,True,False,False,False

I explained that I would never be able to make this flight especially with how big Atlanta is and the first two agents I talked to were not understanding at all. They said that this was legal and that if I missed my flight, I would have to rebook for the next day. I explained this could be resolved by just booking me on an earlier flight out of CLT and two agents refused until I finally got an agent who understood the situation.. I really feel like 35 minutes is so unrealistic for layover time and this needs to be increased to a minimum of one hour. These short layover times are the cause of people missing flights, bags not making it, and rebookings that are unnecessary. Would this be something that is controlled by the FAA or does the airline make up their own layover time rules? EDIT: I came back to say that I got gates now I would have arrived in A at 8:15pm and next flight was out of E boarding at 8:06pm.

Told her I was and started to ask about getting rebooked and she was like ""just go ahead and scan your boarding pass, I'll be back down there in just a second"". So I scanned, walked down the jet bridge to the closed plane door, waited for about 45 seconds then the gate agent walked up, knocked on the door and shouted ""got another passenger for you!"", and to my surprise, she got the thumbs up in the little circle window and popped the door back open and I walked right onto the plane. lol.

All airlines use them. 35 minutes is a pretty standard in the U.S. for a Domestic to Domestic or Domestic to International connection. They factor in the airline and the airport so at some airports/airlines, the MCT is 40 or 45 minutes for itineraries like this. International to Domestic is usually 60+ minutes for MCT. Despite its reputation amongst infrequent travelers, ATL is incredibly easy to connect at and you can make it gate to gate from pretty much anywhere in under 20 minutes. If Delta had a lot of people misconnecting at ATL, then they would increase the MCT. At the end of the day, all the MCT means is the airline believes you can make that connection and if you don’t, they are responsible for rebooking you on a different flight. Whether or not you think that is reasonable is entirely up to you when you purchase your ticket. You are under no obligation to book the MCT. Some people are willing to take more risk than others. If you want the earlier flight and longer layover, book that one instead. Edit to add: this is all assuming the ticket is booked directly with the airline on one reservation.

1it761t,mdrjz7l,1it761t,1,0.13,comment,,"I'm sorry you feel like there are so many people here who aren't providing an echo chamber to agree and validate your observation and opinion. I think a large part was the confusing nature of your post and comments. First, like someone pointed out, you had 45 minutes. That is actually a fairly standard amount of time. Also, boarding time =/= when the plane takes off. It is just an approximate time when people start to line up and then wait to get scanned, wait in the jet bridge, wait in the aisle while people are trying to find their seats, and wait in your seat while everyone else finds their seats. Amazingly enough if the boarding time is 45 mins before the flight takes off, there's usually about 45 minutes of waiting as mentioned above before doors close and the plane takes off, so if you can make it in that window, you are usually good. Over the last 50 or so flights I've taken over the last couple of years with checked luggage (going into big and small airports) probably 30 of them had 45-50 minute connections, and none of them lost luggage. The one that did get delayed (lost) was in Phoenix of all places where I actually had a 2.5 hr connection. Tight connections can get bags tagged and loaded accordingly so they make it on their way. Back to your original point of 35 minutes being tight. There are probably over 500 commercial airports in the US and the vast majority are single terminal or really don't have a ton of gates. It's a matter of threading the needle of thinking what's practical for the handful of large airports versus everyone else. For frequent fliers and business travel, time is money, so less time idling, the better. For more casual or people who may need extra time or accomodations, then take the extra time. The other piece people took issue with was the language around ""Delta"" doing this to you. It came off a little bit like you thought they tricked you into accepting this flight. I think a lot of us have had an experience that when booking on phone or online, that there are multiple options given and then the individual weighs the merits of the options before selecting one. So there is self-responsibility for the ultimate decision unless Delta just forced you to give them payment and forced you to take the original flight and you didn't have any agency to choose. Since you had the wherewithal to post on here, I admit I'm a little surprised that you didn't do a little online research looking at different options and have one in mind before calling to book. All that to say, glad you were able to get your flight changed to give extra time and peace of mind.

Every connection has a legal minimum connection time that must be approved. For example, if you're connecting Charlotte terminal E to terminal C, there is an approved minimum connection time for that combination. If you book the minimum connection, that's legal per your contract of carriage with the airline (the agreement that goes with your ticket that no one actually reads). The airline is not obligated to rebook you because you think it's too short. From their perspective, it's an approved time, so there's no reason to change it. Airline keep statistics for missed connections. Those statistics to into the process of reviewing minimum connection times - if enough people miss their connection, the times will be changed. Airlines do not like missed connections. They must rebook passengers, the original seat usually goes empty, and they loose money. More customer service agents are required the more missed connections there are (even if most of them are rebooked automatically or via self-service), and it's just an inefficient process from a financial and resource perspective.

[See all of our automod responses here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/15neys0/generating_automated_text_responses_to_common/). --- #Schedule Change Following a schedule change by Delta, you typically have three options: 1. Accept the change 2. Request an alternate routing with Delta 3. Cancel for a credit (or refund in certain circumstances) If you wish to accept the change - you typically do not need to take any action. Delta will not pay for any additional accommodation (e.g., extra hotel nights) for changes made known to you in advance of travel. If you would like to request an alternate routing, Delta will typically rebook you on any available same-day Delta marketed itinerary between the same origin and destination, including alternate connection points, waiving any change fee or fare difference. Delta will typically only allow one free change after a schedule change. You may be able to perform the change online, using the change flight feature. However, if you receive an error or the system attempts to charge you, you will need to call or message Delta. Before calling, the rebooking process will be faster if you already know what alternate flight you want. You can find available options on Delta.com by searching for a new flight just like you would for a new purchase. Write down the flight numbers, and tell them to the agent when you call in. There should generally be no charge for this change; you may have to Hang Up and Call Again (HUCA) if the rep is trying to charge you. If you no longer wish to fly, or prefer to book with another carrier, after a schedule change, you can cancel the flight for an eCredit. If the change meets one of the [refund exception criteria](https://pro.delta.com/content/agency/us/en/news/policy-update-archive/2020/august-2020/delta-updates-its-canadian-and-international-contracts-of-carria.html), you may be eligible for a refund instead of an eCredit: * A delay of 120 minutes or more (on either the arrival or departure time) * A change in the routing of a scheduled Delta flight which adds one or more stops to the original itinerary * A change in equipment from Delta Mainline to Delta Connection carrier * Any change that causes a misconnect If the change meets one or more of the exception criteria, and you wish to cancel your travel for a full refund, you can make the request using the [online cancel and refund form](https://www.delta.com/contactus/iropForm). When submitting the form, in the request description, simply state which of the above criteria applies. You will receive an email response to your request in the timeframe indicated at the top of the form. Please note that Schedule Changes are often loaded into schedules on Saturdays. If your itinerary looks pretty messed up, wait til Monday before looking at it again and see if it needs fixing. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1is6vrr,1is6vrr,,0,0,post,Direct Airside Transit Visa Required? (URGENT),"UPDATE: DATV was not required. Hello, I will be traveling from India (BOM) to US (DTW) on Feb 20 2025 with a 3 hours layover in London Airport (LHR). Both the flights are operated by Delta Airlines. I have a valid H1B visa. Asked the airlines but I am getting mixed information from different customer care operators. Can someone confirm this? Especially after the rules change for DATV and ETA from Jan 6 2025. Has anyone made the trip from India to US via London? According to the UK embassy website you are exempt from DATV if you have a valid US visa, which I do. I tried contacting the embassy but no replies to the email or calls as of yet.

1irvhlg,1irvhlg,,0,0,post,Work hour restrictions are not excuses for “weather” delays,"Why is it that the airline industry is able to blame weather when it’s actually just masking their work hour restrictions and ineptitude to hire enough flight staff to cover for pilots and air crew approaching their maximum work hours? Airlines should be more transparent with this and not just merely blame the weather as the only factor. For example my flight yesterday out of LGA was delayed an hour due to fog, and it truly was bad fog, yet plenty of flights were able to leave that evening - excluding my flight. They blamed it on the weather but at take-off time the sky was clear and corroborated by delta staff that it was safe for taking off. Weather was clear at my destination. Why mask the full story? It was the work hour restriction that prevented taking off as by the time of landing our crew would have worked over their legal hours. Solution? Hire more staff and don’t withhold the full picture from your customers.",Easy-Grapefruit2964,0,0.36,6,2025-02-18 05:31:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1irvhlg/work_hour_restrictions_are_not_excuses_for/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1irvhlg/work_hour_restrictions_are_not_excuses_for/,False,True,False,False,False
1irvhlg,mdbndit,1irvhlg,1,0.0,comment,,"Because you’d have too much staff, and flight crews are expensive because they are still getting paid when on reserve. The amount of pilots and flight attendants in each base is determined by a multitude of factors: callout average, number of flights, and yes weather related anomalies. They try to have the expected number of crew to cover every flight plus reserves to cover the averages. If weather is known to be coming, they can surge staff from other bases that have lower need if staff is available (federal regulations and any contractual obligations). All airlines try to balance need with not having too many or too few staff in base, but it’s a delicate balancing act day to day and month to month. The plane or crew could have been coming from a flight affected by weather, as they might change planes while on the ground and be waiting for another plane to come in. LGA is notorious for issuing EDCTs and ground delays as it only has two active runways. They usually use one for landing and one for takeoff (the most optimal configuration). If weather deteriorates and consolidate to one runway operations, GDPs go out. Sometimes it’s luck if you have sufficient resources available, sometimes you aren’t lucky.",bengenj,9,,1,2025-02-18 05:52:34,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1irvhlg/work_hour_restrictions_are_not_excuses_for/mdbndit/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1irvhlg/work_hour_restrictions_are_not_excuses_for/mdbndit/,,,False,False,False

I am a bit worried about the connection time of 6,5 hours. Is uber best/fastest? Or booking a private transfer with a transfer agency?

1ihuzwy,1ihuzwy,,0,0,post,Bereavement Fare Scam,"My grandpa passed away early this morning. My Grandpa meant the world to me - I was very close with him and considered him to be a role model. Unfortunately I live several states away and wanted to get back home to be with my family. I looked up flight prices but thought that I had heard something about Bereavement fares. I looked it up and sure enough it was a thing for Delta. The only requirement was that you had to book through an agent. So, I spoke with an agent who got flights situated for my wife and I. In total the flights they offered me were $100 more expensive than the flights listed on google flights. I asked the agent why that was and was told it was because my tickets from Google would not be refundable while my ticket from them would be refundable. I asked if they could switch it so that my flight would be refundable through them (hoping that would bring the price down). It didn’t. So I just booked online. Then I got to the airport and found out that all 3 of those reservations were charged to my credit card. I was offered a refund, but the chaos this caused during an already difficult time is extraordinarily frustrating. For anyone looking into bereavement fares, I would avoid the hour and half that you will spend on the phone and just get your flights from Google or Expedia. You’ll spend less money that way anyways. I just feel sorry for the non tech savvy people who might be in this situation. They are probably paying more despite Delta advertising bereavement rates.",zombready,0,0.29,6,2025-02-05 06:50:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1ihuzwy/bereavement_fare_scam/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1ihuzwy/bereavement_fare_scam/,False,True,False,False,False

It potentially might be that the charges are still pending, or will fall off of your credit card, because unless you got a confirmation number the system will not process it.

1ih984j,1ih984j,,0,0,post,Lost passport,"Hi all,I lost my passport today while flying from SJC to SLC, flight #DL1314 . The last time I remember seeing it was at the TSA and probably had it on me until I was waiting at gate 12, Terminal A. I didn’t have my passport on me when I landed at Salt Lake City. So I am guessing it fell off my pocket somewhere within SJC. I have reported this to SJC and Delta but I’m panicking because I am a foreigner with no other government issued ID with me. I have a return trip to SJC on the 8th but it’s from PHL. I read on the TSA they allow people to fly domestic without ID incase it is lost or stolen but it’ll take more time for verification. I would like to know what else I can do to ensure I get to travel to SJC on Saturday? And if there’s any chance of me recovering my passport. Plus my flight to country of origin is end of March and I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.

And that's a problem for people who are already underrepresented in the industries they are proficient in because they are often forced to take positions they are overqualified for, for less money, and it's a problem for companies because they stay culturally and linguistically insular and have difficulty trying to poach the actual top-of-the-line talent around the world or making inroads into new countries to do business in.",PeliPal,10,,0,2025-01-31 13:06:18,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1ids9yj/from_delta_air_lines_to_costco_some_companies_say/ma5b78a/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1ids9yj/from_delta_air_lines_to_costco_some_companies_say/ma5b78a/,,,False,False,False

Hire the best person...regardless of color/gender. Again, if the majority of the people going into the field are white men, the majority of hires will be white men.

But I was forced to take a job at one of the companies affiliated with their human trafficking network, SunRun, which has a contract with Costco, and I suffered through an immense amount of harassment while working there. I'm an ethnically Jewish/Gypsy female who's like 5'2"" and weighs ~100 pounds give or take (which is why I'm being targeted by Nazis), but when I went in for my interview, my manager literally thought I was sent there by corporate to test him, because he was just some headass guy who was promoted through nepotism. We worked within Home Depot and Costco, and my manager decided to make me only work in Home Depot, which had a horrible track record of sales, while the other sales rep worked in Costco and was making like $10,000/month. My manager also took me hot tub shopping instead of training me and often took me off the job to go out to eat with him. The Home Depot employees were harassing me and my manager was obviously abusing me, so the Home Depot manager gave me his card and told me to contact him if I needed anything, and then my manager took it from me and told me to let him handle any problems. My manager eventually let me work in Costco, and eventually, the mechanics in Costco started harassing me, walking by and ogling at me and touching me inappropriately. At the same time, they had sent people to sit outside of my apartment and BLARE their music all night for weeks straight to deprive me of sleep, which is both a sex trafficking and brainwashing tactic. I talked to one of my coworkers about what was happening, and he was supportive and agreed that our manager was toxic and incompetent, so it gave me the courage to go to the Home Depot and Costco managers and try to advocate for a better work environment for myself, but of course my manager who was behaving inappropriately with me insisted on being present and even wrote me up in retaliation. (He ended up getting fired after I quit.) Home Depot didn't respond spectacularly, but the Costco manager listened to me, asked me to point out the specific employees who were harassing me, and even offered to call the Vice President of the company to get him involved. TLDR; Elon Musk, Donald Trump, their party, and the Government in its entirety are actually far worse and more dangerous than anyone realizes, and Costco is a pretty good company that actually does care about providing their employees with a safe working environment and treating them with fairness.

I've actually found DL to be one of the easiest airlines to deal with for claims. For example, most companies have security policies against clicking on random external links. They provide a PDF, figure out how to utilize that rather than creating your own method. Similarly, DL advises against checking medicines. You may have had extenuating circumstances, or declared them to the agent, but I'd look through the baggage limitations and remove any non covered items from your claim. Finally, your travel insurance will likely cover anything not covered by DL, though it may also have exclusions for things like medicines.

It was a shitshow. They also refused, initially, to give me an incident number in Atlanta, when I was flying to South Africa, until I video-taped my request for one (pointing the camera at the desk, not the employee). Then they called the airport police on me for filming it, but gave me a number afterward. By this time I was having a bit of a panic attack as I am in the US on a visa - getting arrested even if I'm innocent would be a total disaster for me. They have a clinic at the airport, with a doctor who could have prescribed for me, but refused to do this. I spent 48 hours without my meds. They took three months to find my luggage. So I literally had to replace everything in the bag, as it was all gifts/essentials/clothing like jackets, and tech I needed daily.

What other benefits will I lose that I may not be thinking about? Anyone have recommendations on what to do?

You can’t have your cake (Sky Priority and bag allowance) and eat it too (upgrade for you and the wife only). The trick to have 4 travelers and upgrade 2 of them is to ask customer service to split the reservations: you will end up with 2 separate reservations, 2 people each). However, this means that the kids (on the second rez) lose all benefits, because there is nobody with status on their reservation. While the check-in and gate agent can extend some benefits out of curtesy if you all travel together, I personally don’t believe this is ever worth it. Crucially, your kids lose any kind of protection from IROPS that your status provides: if you all get rebooked automatically, they might end up on a different flight than you; most likely, a worse one than you, who have standby and waitlist priority due to status.",MoistMartini,7,,1,2025-01-18 05:59:25,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1i3r3k7/if_im_platinum_medallion_and_buy_tickets_for_4_of/m7pbet4/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1i3r3k7/if_im_platinum_medallion_and_buy_tickets_for_4_of/m7pbet4/,,,False,False,False

As long as you don’t overstuff it, it should squeeze down enough to fit in the overhead. So boots and soft items in the bag are fine, while your helmet might need to go in a different bag. As a former ski bootfitter I always recommend people avoid checking their boot bag as much as possible. Lost ski bag or clothing is fine because you can rent/demo good skis at any resort and easily replace clothing. Lost ski boots can ruin an entire trip as rental boots universally suck and even if a place rents higher end boots, they won’t be fitted to your foot. As an example, I share what my wife and I will be doing for our ski trip to Japan later this month: Ski bag: our ski bag fits two pairs of skis. Around the skis we will stuff our jackets and pants and other soft items. Our avalanche shovels and probes will also be in this bag as sharp metal pointy things are frowned upon in carry ons. Checked suitcase: Our second checked bag will have our helmets and most of the other clothing for the entire trip. Carry on: we each have a duffel bag that our boots will go in. On top of the boots we can fit a couple of days worth of clothing and other small items. Personal item: slim ski backpacks. With the avalanche gear removed, we will use these bags on travel days for stuff we’ll want in flight like tablets and toiletries.",Fire-the-laser,1,,0,2025-01-08 02:29:26,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1hvi1w0/ski_boot_bag_carry_on/m5wusnf/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1hvi1w0/ski_boot_bag_carry_on/m5wusnf/,,,False,False,False

I don't know the details I just know it's a very long process to go through all the interview process. I dated a girl who's daughter is a FA for AA. She lives with something like 6 other FA's. Since they are are gone so much sharing the bedrooms works out just fine. And it helps with cost because they don't make a lot of money. Also don't be set just on Delta. Apply for other airlines as well.

Base pay is one thing, allowances, flying hours, etc differ for airlines, and even contracts weighing those airlines. OP, only take advice from FAs when it comes to the actual job. Talk to FAs from multiple airlines, consider benefits, how quickly you might gain seniority (expansion potential, etc). Starting pay vs pay in 5,10,20 years. Consider benefits and policies should you get married, have kids, etc. My partner did a mid-life crisis job change to be an FA for a non-US airline (not Emirates). He’s never looked back. There are other options, depending on your comfort level and ability to change. A lot of FAs join Emirates, as their destination list is massive and it’s an easy way to see more places while working. But, you typically live in Dubai in EK housing (look into it). Binge some FA you tube channels. There are quite a few who have been in your place, and talk all about it. As the spouse of a FA, and someone who travels 50+% for work, him being a FA has been very hard on our relationship. We spend a lot of time looking at calendars and changing work plans, doing trip swaps, etc. On the other side, I’ve met a lot of his colleagues who are married to other FAs, and they do just fine. Best of luck to you. If you are passionate about travel, want to be in frontline hospitality/service industry, and are willing to put the time in to get to the point where you get more flexibility, choice, and preference, go for it. Plan well, be flexible, and think outside the box for things like where you live (move back with parents or other family and “commute” and stay in shared apartments with other FAs at your case city). So much to think about.

Summoned via `!companioncert` --- #Companion Certificates Two Delta American Express cards issue a companion certificate upon renewal.

(Official terms: within the United States, Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) to the following destinations: the United States, Puerto Rico, USVI, Mexico, Antigua, Aruba, Bermuda, Bonaire, Grand Cayman, Cuba, Jamaica, Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, Dominican Republic, Saint Kitts, St. Maarten, St. Lucia, Costa Rica, Belize, Guatemala, Panama, Honduras, and El Salvador) * Stopovers, open jaws, and circle trips are not permitted * Most fares require an advance purchase of up to 14 days, a 3 night minimum stay and a 30-day maximum stay * Companion Certificates are eligible for Medallion Complimentary Upgrades, provided that the companion also has their SkyMiles number on their ticket * Non-transferrable once issued * The terms state that the Delta Platinum/Delta Reserve card must be used to pay for the taxes and fees. Sometimes any Amex card will suffice * Companion certificate and Delta eCredits can be combined in the same transaction. Delta eCredits can be applied as payment toward cost of the primary ticket, companion ticket, and any government-imposed taxes and fees. eCredit must match the name of the traveler whose ticket is being purchased * Both passengers must be booked on the same flights and dates, at the same time * Primary ticket will accrue miles and elite credit like normal #American Express (Delta) Platinum Card Note that this is **not** the Platinum Card by American Express. If your card doesn't have a Delta logo on it, then it is not the Amex Delta Platinum card. You can use the Delta Platinum's companion certificate for travel in: * Main Cabin on fare classes L, U, T, X, or V #American Express Delta Reserve Card You can use the Delta Platinum's companion certificate for travel in: * Main Cabin on fare classes L, U, T, X, or V * Comfort+ on fare classes W and S (only when L, U, T, X, or V are available) * First Class on fare classes I and Z * Not eligible to book Delta One #Booking The Delta website should show you availability when you go to https://www.delta.com/redeem when logged in and when you select a companion certificate.

1gv121o,1gv121o,,0,0,post,"Delta may unveil their concept of ""basic business"" tomorrow at their investor day","Delta is hosting an investor day tomorrow. They teased it quite heavily on the last earnings call, and it seems like they will announce some sort of ""unbundled business"" fare or ""basic business"". This could include any of the following changes for the lowest or lower biz fares: * No lounge access * No advanced seat selection/no seat selection/fee to select seat * No free checked bags * No SkyPriority * Change fees? This trend has caught on outside of the US market, but if Delta leads the way here, I'd expect American and United to follow. There are also rumors of meal refreshes and onboard staffing/leadership changes. So ""basic business"" could get thrown in as a negative on top of all the other positives. The irony is that corporate managed travel almost always negotiates against fees and changes. So the basic business would be paid by the premium leisure and SMB or otherwise not-booking-through-Concur crowd. I'd expect to see lots of press about this tomorrow when Delta files their 8Ks and presentations. Edit: [Delta posted their presentation for today's Investor Day](https://s2.q4cdn.com/181345880/files/doc_downloads/2024/investor_day/2024-Delta-Investor-Day-vF-Website.pdf).

And with PS domestic on many of the planes now there isn’t really much room to lower it if they were so inclined. What’s really annoying is that you’re paying for the seat itself in this new scenario - and the seats are mostly worn out and not the comfiest. Some of the FC seats are comfier, definitely wider, but they don’t lay flat. It will also diminish the perk of the new D1 lounges. They’re lovely but I see people often don’t tip / tip well, probably feel they’ve spent enough on D1. If it’s an additional cost a lot of people will likely think I might as well get a great meal in the city. Once they start dissecting everything and pricing separately, the customer will look at everything closer and put a price on each thing. And that’s not a good thing for Delta.

I redeemed by 2024 and 2025 choice rewards for the Regional Upgrade Certificates but I failed to realized the 2024 would have to be used for a flight before January 31. So now I have two questions. Does the RUC apply immediately when you book a flight or a certain amount of time before the flight based on availability? Second, any recommendations based on past experience for flights from the NYC area? Would love to try Delta One but not every flight was offering an upgrade from Main Cabin selections.

We then got out of the plane and instead of using the jet bridge and simply going into the terminal, we went down stairs and onto a bus (two actually), where we waited for the entire flight to deplane before bussing over to a Schengen terminal and exciting. Thankfully it was the part of 2E/2F that they ran shuttles out of, so we cleared passport control (Elite Plus here as well, but no line either way) and waited a few minutes to shuttle bus back to 2L, where our departing flight would leave from. Plenty of time to do it all, with a toddler in a stroller, and still have 20 minutes to burn before boarding for whatever, despite only having a 2hr-ish layover. Not fun - and signs weren't clearest at times, so having a good mental map of the space helps (or physical map if you need that too!), but imminently doable.

1gb0gyu,1gb0gyu,,0,0,post,Delta Flew With 32 Empty Seats Rather Than Letting A Parent Flying Solo With A Toddler Take The Earlier Flight.,"Well, I knew air travel had gotten bad, but wow I have never experienced anything this predatory and disrespectful while flying especially flying alone with a toddler. For starters let me just say every Delta staff member I encountered tried to help me, and was very kind and understanding about the situation. The company policy however... well would rather fly 2 empty seats than easily accomodate a parent traveling alone with a toddler in the early morning. I arrived to the airport early, and ended up being so early for my flight that even the boarding time for the earlier flight to my destination was still an hour away. I figured rather than try to entertain a restless toddler in the seating area for 2 hours, I should see if I could get us on the earlier flight. Like I said, the staff was very nice, but they explained to me because I had purchased Basic Economy tickets they were unable to do anything in the system. Mind you, there were confirmed vacancies on this flight. I overheard an employee briefing the captain that there were still 32 vacancies. 32. Wow. So I figured I had so much time I would reach out to Delta's Customer Service Chat Line and see if there was something they could do. Again, the customer service rep was very kind, and did manage to offer me more options than the desk staff had. The rep offered me to upgrade my ticket so that I could switch flights for $388, more than the entire cost of the original flight. I declined. I asked if I was misunderstanding something, or if Delta was really just going to fly empty seats rather than accomodate us. The rep, who again was very kind and professional, skirted around it and just said the only way to get on that flight was paying the extra $388. I even asked if I waited until boarding finished, and there were still empty seats could we make the switch then? I can absolutely understand if the idea was to keep the option to switch open as long as possible to give priority accommodation to the more expensive ticket holders. It's a tiered system, and we had purchases the lowest tier. Nope. The only way for us to get on that flight was if we paid $388, again that is more than the total cost of the original ROUND TRIP tickets. So to break it down. I had tickets for the exact same flight, this one was just earlier. The plane was not full. There were apparently dozens of empty seats. But Delta would rather fly empty seats, and attempt to extort a parent traveling alone with a toddler, than to accomodate (not prioritize, not offer special treatment, just accomodate) a paying customer. I have always steered away from the budget airlines like Frontier and Spirit because I thought they were nickel and diming you for every little thing. I paid more for these seats on Delta instead by nearly $100 because I thought the established airlines were better equipped to accomodate customers when possible. In my experience flying with my toddler United and American and Jet Blue have been a much better experience, and accommodation is always offered when possible. I just can't wrap my head around this policy, it would have cost them nothing to treat us with basic respect. Next time I need to fly I'll be flying with anyone BUT Delta. Even Frontier or Spirit instead. At least I'm not overpaying for the same level of consideration. TLDR: Delta would not allow me and my toddler to take the earlier flight, that had 32 empty seats on it, without paying more than the price of my original round trip tickets for the priviledge. ETA: Delta customer service is working overtime this morning. Hope you have a nice day.",flight-frown,0,0.16,25,2024-10-24 19:36:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1gb0gyu/delta_flew_with_32_empty_seats_rather_than/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1gb0gyu/delta_flew_with_32_empty_seats_rather_than/,False,True,False,False,False

1g1ky5x,1g1ky5x,,0,0,post,Lost & Found Service keeps you on your toes,"I must have the worst luck. I’m a frequent flyer and recently lost something at LAX but now I’ve lost something on a Delta flight and I didn’t think my lost and found experiences could get worse. I know losing things is my fault, so I didn’t expect anything much. But as a diehard Delta fan, I’m always reading about their constant innovations and love the lounges, so I was expecting more from how their lost and found operation would be. I filled out their online form, which was pretty horrible and long, and was never really contacted or kept updated after that. The item I lost was trackable so I was very puzzled to see it bounce back and forth from where I had initially lost it at my arrival destination to an address in Scottsboro, AL. Only after calling and trying to inquire did I find out it was some store called Unclaimed Baggage where they ship items too first. I thought my item had definitely been stolen or something, as the fact that my item was being sent to a place thousands of miles from where I lost it wasn’t communicated to me at all. In fact, I needed my item for work, so it became a tense situation for me to be kept in the dark for so long. I would have rather been told it was just lost or stolen for good so I could have gone about my business rather than wait so many days wondering why my item kept traveling from one place to another. I’m glad they have some process in place, but keeping customers in the dark for weeks at a time seems so unlike Delta. Finally after a bit of time of my item being in Scottsboro, AL I got an email saying my item was found and I had to pay an exorbitant amount in shipping to get it back. I hope Delta improves this because I’m sure this is a tense and frustrating experience for so many of their passengers. I didn't expect to get my item back at all, so I'm curious if anyone else has had a similar experience.",No-Room2484,1,0.55,3,2024-10-12 05:44:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1g1ky5x/lost_found_service_keeps_you_on_your_toes/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1g1ky5x/lost_found_service_keeps_you_on_your_toes/,False,True,False,False,False

There is nothing to ‘transfer’ just book the tickets from the certificate holders account and just don’t list the certificate holder as a passenger on that ticket. Then to avoid unaccompanied minor fees on the last 3, you’ll need to call in to have an agent help with those. They will ‘link’ them, but linking is just a free text note that the computer system does not use. If an agent is doing manual adjustments (due to irops) they may or may not notice it or abide by it. So know there is a potential to be separated in a worst case scenario (hope for the best have a plan if the worst occurs). One of the challenges you’ll have is finding a flight with 4 companion cert seats available. That is to say, once you book the first cert, they may not be any cert inventory left. You won’t know until after you book. Again an agent would be helpful for this. If you book one cert but there is no more inventory you at least solve the 3rd reservation with unaccompanied minor issue. I’d plan for at least an hour with an agent (after hold time) to find flights and then complete all three bookings. If schedule is your driver then you could just find an acceptable flight and book the first pair and if there is more inventory book the 2nd pair, then call in for the 3rd.",delta8765,3,,1,2024-10-09 00:55:48,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1fyecp0/companion_certificates/lqyr0lm/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1fyecp0/companion_certificates/lqyr0lm/,,,False,False,False

I’ve been checking my Delta profile certificates section daily since then to ensure that the companion certificate has been issued, which has not been issued. I reached out to Delta about two weeks ago and they told me that August and September 2024 companion certificates have not been issued due to a technical issue with Amex. Still without a companion certificate nearly a month after the renewal, I reached out to Amex this evening. They finally confirmed, after going back and forth with a frontline CS agent and a supervisor—when I asked if they have not issued certificates for August and September renewals, the supervisor confirmed that they have not issued July, August, or September certificates. I asked why there has not been a communication to customers about the issue and shouldn’t there be compensation in the form of renewal extensions due to the inability to use the greatest value benefit, in my opinion, of the Delta Reserve card. He said those were valid points and would elevate them and to check back in a week. So, if your renewal was in July, August, or September have you received your companion certificate?

1fovj5f,1fovj5f,,0,0,post,I have never been so disappointed with an airline service as much as I am now with Delta,"I have spent from 4:10 PM until now just rebooking my family's flights. The sad part is that I have tried over and over again to do it as I usually do, to self-serve; however, over and over again, the system is failing and giving error messages. True enough, I started to seek customer service assistance through chat. Nothing. They cannot answer the most straightforward questions and cannot help one bit. I had issues even timing flights and was confused between AM and PM. I already gave out all the flight details. Still, they were confused. I gave up and decided to call. Lo and behold 52 minutes wait time. That's not the icing on top, though. After a gruelling six or so hours, I then had to download all my receipts because, of course, I had swallowed all the fare differences amounting to over 2K USD, even if the flights I took were already flexible dates but with fare difference charges. Fair enough. But to top it all off, I cannot download my itinerary even if it's showing me on my app the changes made. Much to my dismay, i chatted with an associate again. She was sweet. Recognised the issue immediately. She recognized it was an error in the system. Of course, having spent the amount of time I spent. And rightfully so. All of the transactions have been pending in my account, and I received charges on my AMEX card. Then gets transferred to the next agent. Because of course, somebody had to do it, so I had to be transferred again. After reviewing my case again for another 20 or so minutes. I waited and finally got a response back from the agent saying, sorry, ""I can't waive any charges for you because we can see it processed; however, the ticket wasn't issued, meaning it will only be on hold until such time, and then it will drop. If you want to secure your flights, I must reprocess and recharge you. I guess the frustrating part is that there is no effort at all to make things right. Do this or lose your flights. I told them I booked my family on a separate booking, so I had no choice. The response to me was almost insulting, just saying, well, can you give me the confirmation code of your family? It's just.... frustrating. My point here is that there is no amount of effort that they can give my time back, but also the frustration their system brought, and to top it off, double charge you, and you know, it should fall off in the next couple or so days. The lack of empathy is an understatement of frustration for me. I also requested some logs, etc., because even the pricing on the website is wrong with what they are telling me on the phone. This is clearly a BBB issue, but the only thing I have is here's a link to file your complaint. I have been a Medallion member since 2010. I have my Delta rewards card for AMEX even if I have never used the travel companion certificate because, of course, fare restrictions on classes are just a nice touch of F\*\*\* Y\*\* for thinking you can use it. But now it's a good time to say how much Delta cares for their customers. SO frustrating and, I guess, a slap in the face. Thanks, Delta. I have never felt more disappointed.",Specialist_Voice_809,0,0.32,6,2024-09-25 11:47:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1fovj5f/i_have_never_been_so_disappointed_with_an_airline/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1fovj5f/i_have_never_been_so_disappointed_with_an_airline/,False,True,False,False,False

In the olden days you did used to be able to use the Platinum card and pay 50 bucks to get in but no more. The reserve card does cost 650 and does give lounge access up to 15 times a year. You have the platinum which is why no lounge access for you! But, you also aren't paying $650. I'm guessing you haven't realized that yet because you're in your first year and the fee is probably waived. I've had the platinum for years and I'm thinking of upgrading but I've had enough experience with lounges that it gives me pause. Airports have gotten nicer. There's usually nice restaurants and other nice places to hang out without going into a lounge. Meanwhile the lounges have turned to crap.

1f5qoyc,1f5qoyc,,0,0,post,Delta refused to accept my dog on the spot even I have a prior pet confirmed reservation,"For context, we are really in a rush to fly my dog from Philippines to USA because we would like to follow the old CDC Import rule which is 2-3x cheaper than the new rule. So we booked a connecting flight with Philippine Airlines (MNL to TPE) and Delta Air (TPE to SEA). All were going well, we’re already seated inside the plane and my was in the cargo already - not until a cabin crew approached us and told us that Delta said they cannot accept our dog for the available aircraft they have for our next flight. That they can just accept a service dog which is not applicable to my dog. PAL crew asked us right on the spot if we want to take this flight and just leave our dog or get off the plane (in a nice way btw) so we had no choice but to just get off the plane because who the hell will leave her dog, right??? We called Delta air and asked what happened, what’s their solution. They booked us for another flight the next day (earliest they can book us), same time - EVA + Delta. We went back home. The next day, we arrived in the airport and headed to EVA for check in. The crew said they cannot accept our dog because we only have US import permit and not Taiwan permit. So we were so confused because we never had an issue with PAL about Taiwan permit even we have the same route??? I researched about it online and found out it needs to be requested atleast 20days before the flight. And also, we were so mad at this point because why would Delta/PAL rebooked us to that flight without considering that, right?! EVA crew also said that we need to also secure a pet reservation 48hrs prior the flight itself which is impossible because ours was just rebooked yesterday. My dog got stressed really bad as she’s not used to being caged for so long so we decided to sent her back home to my family. And that means we will need to reprocess all the things we did to get her permit and pay more because we will be flying her under new rule soon. Delta rebooked the flight and we had to wait 6hrs in the airport to take that flight. My fiancè had to missed 1 day of his work because he couldnt make it on time for work due to delays happened. We landed back in USA, Aug 26. To anyone who’s familiar on how to file claims against the airline, how do we go about this? We need help, what happened was really stressful and devastating for us.

1epetq9,lhk6iy4,1epetq9,1,0.3,comment,,Go on KLM’s website to choose a seat. Get your KLM reservation number. (Might be in the email. Delta’s number might work) Make sure you are properly seated. Call reservations to get the code if you can’t find it. You can screw this up by getting a klm frequent flyer number and somehow having your stuff credited to them instead of Delta. Try not to do that.,OneofLittleHarmony,2,,0,2024-08-11 16:08:38,https://reddit.com/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1epetq9/where_did_my_seat_go/lhk6iy4/,/r/DeltaAirlines/comments/1epetq9/where_did_my_seat_go/lhk6iy4/,,,False,False,False
