Ang dami rin na nagbago sa terminal 3 may mga kiosk na. 1. Wala bang magiging problema if ako yung nag check in nung flight through online? (ate ko kasi yung bumili ng ticket so account nya sa cebupac yung gamit, sinend nya lang yung details nung flight/qr code) May napapanood kasi ako sa tiktok (i did some research din) na pwede mag check in through their kiosk, quarter to 5 kasi yung flight namin so naisip ko na baka mag online check in nalang ako para kahit nasa bahay pa kami yung check in baggage nalang yung iisipin ko sa airport. kaso ayun nga baka magkaproblema sa app check in kasi hindi ko account (email nya yung gamit, hindi ba sa email isesend yung boarding pass?) and if sa kiosk naman baka hiwalay kami ng seat nung bata ko na kapatid (bali 2 lang kami) also note po na balak namin pumunta ng terminal 3 ng 12am since quarter to 5 pa naman samin gusto ko kasi smooth lang byahe namin huhu 2. Pag dating po ba sa baggage ikikilo pa nila if through kiosk ka nag check in ng baggage? may 20kilos kasi ako na baggage.

How about yung hand carry po? may tig 7kilos kami na hand carry and 20 lang yung size nung luggage ko acceptable ba yung size or need na back pack? 4. Kinikilo pa po ba yung hand carry if online check in? nakita ko po kasi na possible daw po na hindi na since online yung check in nya. 5. Bawal po ba yung prutas sa check in baggage? ano po need gawin para hindi makuha yung mga pagkain(mostly prutas or gulay talaga) na dadalhin pabalik ng manila? Pag balik po kasi may mga dala kaming prutas, nasa baggage naman po sya kaso may nakikita ako na mahigpit cebupac pagdating sa ganon? baka ipatanggal sa baggage namin. also na experience ko na before nung pabalik na rin kami manila tinanggal yung durian huhu. this time parang wala naman kaming dala na durian kasi baka sa mismong airport na kami bumili (allowed daw kasi pag sa airport bumili) 6. Pwede po ba may pagkain sa hand carry? wala naman syang amoy, yung mooncake na nakalagay sa tin can sya. pwede ba sa hand carry yun or dapat sa baggage?? saka may plastic na nakabalot kada piece nung mooncake kaya kahit walang tin can okay lang sya. pasalubong din sana yun sa ate ko. ayun lang naman po, hindi ko kasi matanong ate ko since super busy sya sa trabaho nya. hindi kasi ako makampante eh.",gyalof4e,1,1.0,0,2025-11-13 23:56:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/CebuPacific/comments/1ow4qon/questions_about_cebu_pacific_flight/,/r/CebuPacific/comments/1ow4qon/questions_about_cebu_pacific_flight/,False,True,False,False,False,Cebu Pacific,"Questions about Cebu Pacific Flight Hello po, I have some questions regarding sa cebu pacific flight ko this december I hope y'all can help me medyo nalilito kasi ako.

Normally, you'd be looking at least double that, often more, especially if you're not booking far in advance or during an off-peak season. If that 4600 pesos is for a legitimate airline with reasonable layovers, you should probably snag it quickly, as deals like that don't last long. Sometimes budget airlines have flash sales or you catch a dynamic pricing sweet spot. Consider checking the baggage allowance and any other hidden fees, as low prices sometimes mean you pay extra for everything else. But even with some add-ons, that base fare is fantastic. Once you've got your flights sorted, the next fun part is planning what you'll do once you get there. Bangkok has so much to offer, from temples and markets to street food tours and river cruises.

Nakapag book na po ako ng one way pero ung pino-problema ko po is pabalik, wala na pong available flights 😔 puro na sya regular flights, nagcheck ako nung 8am based sa sinabi nila ma mag refresh ung mga trips. May pag asa pa po kaya na may mag open ulit na trips for ceb superpass? Napapaisip na tuloy ako kung nakamura ba talaga ako dito. Kasi ung stress ng pag iisip kung pano makaka-book ng pabalik using ceb superpass, ang hirap 😫. 1st time ko din po to purchase this superpass last year. Any tips to successfully booked baka meron po kayo dyan? Thank youuuuu! 🫶 \*\*\*\*UPDATE: Nakapagbook naman na po ako ng pabalik which is Monday na instead of Sunday kasi un lang talaga may available. Original plan is Wednesday to Sunday lang sana pero Monday lang may available na pabalik so na-extend ung itinerary namin ng 1 day pa. Thank you po sa lahat ng sumagot! 🫶 Sana may naitulong po itong thread sa may mga cebpass pa. 😊",2025-10-24 11:19:27,1,NON_TOXIC,0.8965198971770559,0.8965198971770559,0.09278517415786787,0.010072139630323771,0.0006181145127519043,4.674522000436158e-06

Reported it to the CebuPac staff minutes after arrival, filled out the PIR document, and was advised to wait for them to reach out. They never did... I tried reaching out to them, but didn't get a response. I immediately got the issue escalated with CAB, but across the 41 days since my luggage was lost upon arrival, all we've received are their never-ending follow-up emails. The CebuPac rep sent 6 'follow-up emails' as a response to me and CAB in our very long email thread. What's there to follow up with their team 6 times? The luggage was already lost, and they won't compensate as per their policy. Is anyone able to get actual compensation for their lost luggage? Or is this just CebuPac's modus operandi to dodge financial responsibilities with regard to compensating their passengers for lost luggage? I can't imagine how many other locals and foreigners fell for this tactic that led them to give up on their lost luggage.",2025-09-16 11:45:28,2,MILD,0.8790208477560691,0.08370561386310649,0.8790208477560691,0.03477067667222035,0.0020868951686065763,0.0004159665399974996
