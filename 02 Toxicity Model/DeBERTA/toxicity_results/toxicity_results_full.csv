Ang dami rin na nagbago sa terminal 3 may mga kiosk na. 1. Wala bang magiging problema if ako yung nag check in nung flight through online? (ate ko kasi yung bumili ng ticket so account nya sa cebupac yung gamit, sinend nya lang yung details nung flight/qr code) May napapanood kasi ako sa tiktok (i did some research din) na pwede mag check in through their kiosk, quarter to 5 kasi yung flight namin so naisip ko na baka mag online check in nalang ako para kahit nasa bahay pa kami yung check in baggage nalang yung iisipin ko sa airport. kaso ayun nga baka magkaproblema sa app check in kasi hindi ko account (email nya yung gamit, hindi ba sa email isesend yung boarding pass?) and if sa kiosk naman baka hiwalay kami ng seat nung bata ko na kapatid (bali 2 lang kami) also note po na balak namin pumunta ng terminal 3 ng 12am since quarter to 5 pa naman samin gusto ko kasi smooth lang byahe namin huhu 2. Pag dating po ba sa baggage ikikilo pa nila if through kiosk ka nag check in ng baggage? may 20kilos kasi ako na baggage.

How about yung hand carry po? may tig 7kilos kami na hand carry and 20 lang yung size nung luggage ko acceptable ba yung size or need na back pack? 4. Kinikilo pa po ba yung hand carry if online check in? nakita ko po kasi na possible daw po na hindi na since online yung check in nya. 5. Bawal po ba yung prutas sa check in baggage? ano po need gawin para hindi makuha yung mga pagkain(mostly prutas or gulay talaga) na dadalhin pabalik ng manila? Pag balik po kasi may mga dala kaming prutas, nasa baggage naman po sya kaso may nakikita ako na mahigpit cebupac pagdating sa ganon? baka ipatanggal sa baggage namin. also na experience ko na before nung pabalik na rin kami manila tinanggal yung durian huhu. this time parang wala naman kaming dala na durian kasi baka sa mismong airport na kami bumili (allowed daw kasi pag sa airport bumili) 6. Pwede po ba may pagkain sa hand carry? wala naman syang amoy, yung mooncake na nakalagay sa tin can sya. pwede ba sa hand carry yun or dapat sa baggage?? saka may plastic na nakabalot kada piece nung mooncake kaya kahit walang tin can okay lang sya. pasalubong din sana yun sa ate ko. ayun lang naman po, hindi ko kasi matanong ate ko since super busy sya sa trabaho nya. hindi kasi ako makampante eh.",gyalof4e,1,1.0,0,2025-11-13 23:56:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/CebuPacific/comments/1ow4qon/questions_about_cebu_pacific_flight/,/r/CebuPacific/comments/1ow4qon/questions_about_cebu_pacific_flight/,False,True,False,False,False,Cebu Pacific,"Questions about Cebu Pacific Flight Hello po, I have some questions regarding sa cebu pacific flight ko this december I hope y'all can help me medyo nalilito kasi ako.

Normally, you'd be looking at least double that, often more, especially if you're not booking far in advance or during an off-peak season. If that 4600 pesos is for a legitimate airline with reasonable layovers, you should probably snag it quickly, as deals like that don't last long. Sometimes budget airlines have flash sales or you catch a dynamic pricing sweet spot. Consider checking the baggage allowance and any other hidden fees, as low prices sometimes mean you pay extra for everything else. But even with some add-ons, that base fare is fantastic. Once you've got your flights sorted, the next fun part is planning what you'll do once you get there. Bangkok has so much to offer, from temples and markets to street food tours and river cruises.

Kasi ung stress ng pag iisip kung pano makaka-book ng pabalik using ceb superpass, ang hirap 😫. 1st time ko din po to purchase this superpass last year. Any tips to successfully booked baka meron po kayo dyan? Thank youuuuu! 🫶 \*\*\*\*UPDATE: Nakapagbook naman na po ako ng pabalik which is Monday na instead of Sunday kasi un lang talaga may available. Original plan is Wednesday to Sunday lang sana pero Monday lang may available na pabalik so na-extend ung itinerary namin ng 1 day pa. Thank you po sa lahat ng sumagot! 🫶 Sana may naitulong po itong thread sa may mga cebpass pa. 😊",2025-10-24 11:19:27,1,NON_TOXIC,0.8965198971770559,0.8965198971770559,0.09278517415786787,0.010072139630323771,0.0006181145127519043,4.674522000436158e-06

I immediately got the issue escalated with CAB, but across the 41 days since my luggage was lost upon arrival, all we've received are their never-ending follow-up emails. The CebuPac rep sent 6 'follow-up emails' as a response to me and CAB in our very long email thread. What's there to follow up with their team 6 times? The luggage was already lost, and they won't compensate as per their policy. Is anyone able to get actual compensation for their lost luggage? Or is this just CebuPac's modus operandi to dodge financial responsibilities with regard to compensating their passengers for lost luggage? I can't imagine how many other locals and foreigners fell for this tactic that led them to give up on their lost luggage.",2025-09-16 11:45:28,2,MILD,0.8790208477560691,0.08370561386310649,0.8790208477560691,0.03477067667222035,0.0020868951686065763,0.0004159665399974996

It’s okay to book through online but I’d just use the web browser for that since the app is web based for that except with miles. It has a really long way to go before I’d even consider it decent and average compared to the international competition. Edit: Back because I was trying to check miles booking on the app and it just closes the app after I do face id sign in.",2025-11-17 11:07:20,1,NON_TOXIC,0.6377608837867084,0.6377608837867084,0.35940041986992965,0.0028351725336477262,3.3181818006057513e-06,2.0562791363105508e-07

So if another flight was shown on the screen (haven’t been changed to the current one), then it’s the fault of the airport management. If your gate falls on gate 1, 2, 7, 8, 15 and 16, any announcements made inside those gates aren’t heard across the terminal, likewise if announcements are made on gates 3-6 or 9-12, one cam hear them on that specific area only.",2025-10-08 19:08:16,2,MILD,0.8264227882737704,0.16690484362850913,0.8264227882737704,0.006498289657646758,0.00012659321209412938,4.748522797966892e-05

Immigration and customs will take at least 30 minutes, assuming you have a checked bag or two, and that is a best case scenario. It will be worse if there are other arriving flights ahead of yours, or you are seated at the back of the plane, or if your bags are among the last to be offloaded. From 2 hours, you now have 90 minutes, maybe less. Have you been to MNL before? Terminals are not connected at all. Make sure PAL transfers your checked bags to your connecting flight. The terminal shuttle departs every 30 minutes but had a reputation of being irregular and unreliable. Depending on the hour, traffic can be at a crawl. Let’s pretend you just missed it and have to wait. Down to 60 minutes. You might be better off getting a Grab instead of waiting since it will buy you time. Then, once at Terminal 2, you have to queue up for security, assuming you already have your connecting boarding pass. Let’s assume another 30 minutes to get to the gate. So you have only 30 minutes of actual travel time. Which, depending on bureaucracy, traffic and the shuttle, is totally doable. Now let’s go back to your 2 hour layover time. Is that from landing to departure time? Or is it landing to close-the-gate time? Or is it landing to boarding time? If it is departure time, you need to deduct 15 minutes, since PAL closes the gates 15 minutes before departure time. It is even more, 30 minutes, for Caticlan. PAL recommends being at the airport 45 minutes before departure time assuming you have no luggage. So instead of 2 hours, should you be thinking it is only 1 hour 15 minutes layover, since it isn’t a typical layover where the airport is self contained and the terminals are all connected? Minus maybe an hour for immigration, customs, and transit. That means you have a buffer of 15 minutes. Personally, I would probably want a bit more of a cushion. It sounds stressful, unless you like that kind of thing. And yes, I tend to be a pessimist but practical when making travel arrangements.

Filipino passports has a different line for middle names on their passport and Canadians passport do not (its written right after our first name). Anyways, I called their support line to confirm and was first told that it didnt matter but then was told after that it did and I should submit a name correction request on their website. So, I made this request on their website and uploaded my passport. Later on, I got an email response stating that my middle name is not required for my flight. Called westjet as well since they are my first flight from saskatoon to Vancouver, and they said it shouldn’t matter with them. Im just worried and confused now.

Just the past month, I have encountered 3 successive PAL-pak which is only expected on low budget airlines. 1.

Instead of PAL staff to assist us, we were made to carry the checked in luggages by ourselves, got into the bus, and carried them down from the bus. It was very difficult because we had an elderly with us. Nobody volunteered to assist us from PAL. Also, instructions were confusing in NAIA as to transfer luggages when we arrived 2.

1hl6tlw,1hl6tlw,,0,0,post,Check in cardboard box in PAL International Flight,"Hi! Anyone here who has tried checking in cardboard box in international flight? I'll be going back from Japan to Philippines next month via Philippine Airlines. Thing is, I have a 27 inch monitor and I'm planning to bring it with me. I checked the website and found this: >For economy class service two pieces of checked baggage of which the sum of the three dimensions of each bag does not exceed 62 inches (158 cms) and provided the weight of each piece of checked baggage allowance does not exceed 50 lbs (23 kgs). [Source](https://www.philippineairlines.com/content/dam/palportal/migration/files/pdf/prpr1-as-of-15dec22-rule-115.pdf) So I plan to put the monitor back to its original box and put it in checked baggage. Since the box is quite thick and it's much safer compared to putting the monitor in my luggage (without the box).

Anyone here who has tried checking in cardboard box in international flight? I'll be going back from Japan to Philippines next month via Philippine Airlines. Thing is, I have a 27 inch monitor and I'm planning to bring it with me. I checked the website and found this: >For economy class service two pieces of checked baggage of which the sum of the three dimensions of each bag does not exceed 62 inches (158 cms) and provided the weight of each piece of checked baggage allowance does not exceed 50 lbs (23 kgs). [Source](https://www.philippineairlines.com/content/dam/palportal/migration/files/pdf/prpr1-as-of-15dec22-rule-115.pdf) So I plan to put the monitor back to its original box and put it in checked baggage.
