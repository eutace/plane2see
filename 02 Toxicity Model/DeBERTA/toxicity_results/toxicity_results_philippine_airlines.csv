1owwup4,1owwup4,,0,0,post,PAL carry on luggage size,"Hi! So I recently bought a Voyager Luggage as my carry on for my upcoming trip to Boracay, and I noticed that the dimensions are slightly bigger than the common carry on luggage size (56cm x 36cm x 23cm). I bought it at SM dept store, I repeatedly asked the sales person if it will fit in the overhead bin? They assured me that it is the standard size. I forgot to consider the dimensions of the luggage before buying. Here are the measurements that I took: L - 33cm W - 28cm H - 56cm w/ wheels, 52cm w/o wheels \*I think it is a ""trunk"" style luggage? And it is also expandable. I am quite anxious about this since it's my first luggage and it's also my first time travelling via plane. Do you think it will fit in PAL's overhead cabins? How about in other airlines? It's a week before my flight and I want to avoid paying additional charges as much as possible. Is it better if I just avail the additional baggage add on? Or should I just bet on my chances, and hope that they'll allow it at the check in counter? https://preview.redd.it/pn8gahf9881g1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22d446184c2c3ae54a08f4f8147a34363ce4d3cc",Green-Win1651,1,1.0,3,2025-11-14 21:43:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/philippineairlines/comments/1owwup4/pal_carry_on_luggage_size/,/r/philippineairlines/comments/1owwup4/pal_carry_on_luggage_size/,False,True,False,False,False,Philippine Airlines,"PAL carry on luggage size Hi!

I was trying to book a flight for two people from Canada to the Philippines directly through the Philippine Airlines website.

I proceeded to checkout but got an error message saying the booking couldn’t be completed due to missing information. At the same time, my sister (on a separate computer) was also trying to book and got the same error. However, and here’s where it gets messy, when I checked my email and credit card afterward, I noticed I had been charged for one ticket and only one traveler was ticketed, even though I had selected two. I reached out to Philippine Airlines to request a refund because I wanted both travelers under the same booking number and didn’t feel confident booking the second ticket separately. But they told me the fare I booked is non-refundable, even though this was clearly a system glitch. They did ask for screenshots of the error message, which I luckily had saved and sent over, including proof that I had selected two passengers in the original booking. Now I’m stuck with a ticket I don’t want to use, for an airline I don’t want to proceed with anymore (especially after reading more reviews).

Immigration and customs will take at least 30 minutes, assuming you have a checked bag or two, and that is a best case scenario. It will be worse if there are other arriving flights ahead of yours, or you are seated at the back of the plane, or if your bags are among the last to be offloaded. From 2 hours, you now have 90 minutes, maybe less. Have you been to MNL before? Terminals are not connected at all. Make sure PAL transfers your checked bags to your connecting flight. The terminal shuttle departs every 30 minutes but had a reputation of being irregular and unreliable. Depending on the hour, traffic can be at a crawl. Let’s pretend you just missed it and have to wait. Down to 60 minutes. You might be better off getting a Grab instead of waiting since it will buy you time. Then, once at Terminal 2, you have to queue up for security, assuming you already have your connecting boarding pass. Let’s assume another 30 minutes to get to the gate. So you have only 30 minutes of actual travel time. Which, depending on bureaucracy, traffic and the shuttle, is totally doable. Now let’s go back to your 2 hour layover time. Is that from landing to departure time? Or is it landing to close-the-gate time? Or is it landing to boarding time? If it is departure time, you need to deduct 15 minutes, since PAL closes the gates 15 minutes before departure time. It is even more, 30 minutes, for Caticlan. PAL recommends being at the airport 45 minutes before departure time assuming you have no luggage. So instead of 2 hours, should you be thinking it is only 1 hour 15 minutes layover, since it isn’t a typical layover where the airport is self contained and the terminals are all connected? Minus maybe an hour for immigration, customs, and transit. That means you have a buffer of 15 minutes. Personally, I would probably want a bit more of a cushion. It sounds stressful, unless you like that kind of thing. And yes, I tend to be a pessimist but practical when making travel arrangements.

We have flown abroad using PAL most of the time, direct, since we are from the province. At least 3x a year as family and some domestic flight individually. We have noticed the decline of their services post-pandemic. I wonder if the management has done cost cutting. Just the past month, I have encountered 3 successive PAL-pak which is only expected on low budget airlines. 1. In our recent trip from abroad, we booked connecting flight because it was promised that check-thru will be a lot easier especially with several luggages for family trips. The PAL international flight arrived 1 hour late. And we have around 1 hour left to transfer to domestic airport. Instead of PAL staff to assist us, we were made to carry the checked in luggages by ourselves, got into the bus, and carried them down from the bus. It was very difficult because we had an elderly with us. Nobody volunteered to assist us from PAL. Also, instructions were confusing in NAIA as to transfer luggages when we arrived 2.
