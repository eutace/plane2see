1owwup4,1owwup4,,0,0,post,PAL carry on luggage size,"Hi! So I recently bought a Voyager Luggage as my carry on for my upcoming trip to Boracay, and I noticed that the dimensions are slightly bigger than the common carry on luggage size (56cm x 36cm x 23cm). I bought it at SM dept store, I repeatedly asked the sales person if it will fit in the overhead bin? They assured me that it is the standard size. I forgot to consider the dimensions of the luggage before buying. Here are the measurements that I took: L - 33cm W - 28cm H - 56cm w/ wheels, 52cm w/o wheels \*I think it is a ""trunk"" style luggage? And it is also expandable. I am quite anxious about this since it's my first luggage and it's also my first time travelling via plane. Do you think it will fit in PAL's overhead cabins? How about in other airlines? It's a week before my flight and I want to avoid paying additional charges as much as possible. Is it better if I just avail the additional baggage add on? Or should I just bet on my chances, and hope that they'll allow it at the check in counter? https://preview.redd.it/pn8gahf9881g1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22d446184c2c3ae54a08f4f8147a34363ce4d3cc",Green-Win1651,1,1.0,3,2025-11-14 21:43:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/philippineairlines/comments/1owwup4/pal_carry_on_luggage_size/,/r/philippineairlines/comments/1owwup4/pal_carry_on_luggage_size/,False,True,False,False,False

(1) Arriving sa T2 - madali lang, sumunod ka lang sa mga kasabay mo, if may check in bags ka na need e-claim, they will announce it kung saang carousel - again, follow the crowd papunta dun. Look at the monitors, naka indicate naman sa screen yung flight details. If nakuha mo na bags mo and ur ready to leave the terminal, exit is just behind the claiming area. Proceed sa bay area for your transport. For your peace of mind, install mo muna Grab app and book ur ride from T2 after mo makuha bags mo. I highly suggest na WAG kang gagamit ng taxi. Baka mabudol ka sa fare price. (2) Departing from T2 - magbigay ng 1-2 hours allowance sa departure time mo. Pero simple lang ang proseso, and may mag assist naman sa’yo mula pagpasok mo sa terminal. Again, maliit lang ang T2, hindi ka maliligaw or mawawala. Don’t lose your boarding pass (if printed), take note of your boarding gate number, and always be mindful sa announcements. If may time ka pa, stroll around the terminal, get to know the area or buy snacks. T2 is just like a long curved street, easy to navigate :) If it’s not too obvious, I always fly with PAL (domestic) for work and I fly in and out of T2 at least 6 times a month :)",No_Flight1000,1,,0,2025-11-15 02:52:46,https://reddit.com/r/philippineairlines/comments/1ov0hiv/first_time_traveling_via_plane/nourb0c/,/r/philippineairlines/comments/1ov0hiv/first_time_traveling_via_plane/nourb0c/,,,False,False,False

1nxk414,1nxk414,,0,0,post,My first and most probably last time with PAL. And the baffling carry on limit of Goldilocks (300g limit packs),"My first time flying with PAL and probably my last time. I’m baffled with how many emails I get prior to my flight about change of time of departure, aircraft change, and seat changes as a result (I appreciate the heads up) but here’s the kicker, I’m on a transit flight via NAIA and I can barely find any information about the gate of my connecting flight. Upon learning the designated gate, I then proceed to said gate to wait for boarding (the gate was unattended with multiple passengers waiting along with me. 10mins to ETD, an airport assistant (cleaning lady) came down and said gate has changed (no email and announcement over the PA). When I proceeded to the said new gate, the gate screen was displaying another flight to another city. When I approached the gate agent about this issue, gate agent insist that an announcement was already made and about the signage display… I was given a “oh, they haven’t changed it yet?”.

I’m thinking perhaps it was duty-free and since they have to deliver the duty-free they don’t want to take a chance on having someone tell them that they cannot accept that or the gate agent telling them they cannot accept that and then they have to deal with a return Which by the way, I think the 7 kg policy is utterly stupid That’s barely the weight of an empty bag. People carry computer, computers, cameras, and other things that they don’t want the handlers to abuse or lose and need to carry on more than 7kg.

1lj8bwn,1lj8bwn,,0,0,post,Advice: System Error PAL,"Hoping someone out there has some advice or has gone through something similar. I was trying to book a flight for two people from Canada to the Philippines directly through the Philippine Airlines website. When I went through the booking portal, I had selected two passengers and the total cost showed as approximately $2,000 CAD. I proceeded to checkout but got an error message saying the booking couldn’t be completed due to missing information. At the same time, my sister (on a separate computer) was also trying to book and got the same error. However, and here’s where it gets messy, when I checked my email and credit card afterward, I noticed I had been charged for one ticket and only one traveler was ticketed, even though I had selected two. I reached out to Philippine Airlines to request a refund because I wanted both travelers under the same booking number and didn’t feel confident booking the second ticket separately. But they told me the fare I booked is non-refundable, even though this was clearly a system glitch. They did ask for screenshots of the error message, which I luckily had saved and sent over, including proof that I had selected two passengers in the original booking. Now I’m stuck with a ticket I don’t want to use, for an airline I don’t want to proceed with anymore (especially after reading more reviews). Has anyone gone through something similar with PAL or another airline? Any tips on how I might still be able to get a refund or dispute the charge through my credit card company?

It will be worse if there are other arriving flights ahead of yours, or you are seated at the back of the plane, or if your bags are among the last to be offloaded. From 2 hours, you now have 90 minutes, maybe less. Have you been to MNL before? Terminals are not connected at all. Make sure PAL transfers your checked bags to your connecting flight. The terminal shuttle departs every 30 minutes but had a reputation of being irregular and unreliable. Depending on the hour, traffic can be at a crawl. Let’s pretend you just missed it and have to wait. Down to 60 minutes. You might be better off getting a Grab instead of waiting since it will buy you time. Then, once at Terminal 2, you have to queue up for security, assuming you already have your connecting boarding pass. Let’s assume another 30 minutes to get to the gate. So you have only 30 minutes of actual travel time. Which, depending on bureaucracy, traffic and the shuttle, is totally doable. Now let’s go back to your 2 hour layover time. Is that from landing to departure time? Or is it landing to close-the-gate time? Or is it landing to boarding time? If it is departure time, you need to deduct 15 minutes, since PAL closes the gates 15 minutes before departure time. It is even more, 30 minutes, for Caticlan. PAL recommends being at the airport 45 minutes before departure time assuming you have no luggage. So instead of 2 hours, should you be thinking it is only 1 hour 15 minutes layover, since it isn’t a typical layover where the airport is self contained and the terminals are all connected? Minus maybe an hour for immigration, customs, and transit. That means you have a buffer of 15 minutes. Personally, I would probably want a bit more of a cushion. It sounds stressful, unless you like that kind of thing. And yes, I tend to be a pessimist but practical when making travel arrangements. If PAL says it is doable and sells the ticket that way, it probably is. And of course, if you miss your flight, PAL will put you on the next one, but is it worth the extra stress?",MotownMan646,1,,1,2025-04-17 20:13:35,https://reddit.com/r/philippineairlines/comments/1k17we5/2_hrs_transfers_from_naia_r1_to_t2_is_enoughim/mnklqxo/,/r/philippineairlines/comments/1k17we5/2_hrs_transfers_from_naia_r1_to_t2_is_enoughim/mnklqxo/,,,False,False,False

If the connection is tight but already checked in they have ground staff you will assist and sometimes guide you to get between terminals.

However, just let the ground staff know your connecting flight is tight especially when you land at MNL. Also check with the transfer counter at the terminal (Terminal 1 is at the far right after the baggage claim before the exit).

When I was booking the middle name says it was optional, so I just left it blank. Didnt think much of it since it says optional, but now im worried that I’ll have problems boarding since i heard ur ticket must match the name on hr passport. I talked to one of their agent via their webchat and was told since I have a canadian passport and my middle name is part of my given name(s) it should be included in my ticket. Filipino passports has a different line for middle names on their passport and Canadians passport do not (its written right after our first name). Anyways, I called their support line to confirm and was first told that it didnt matter but then was told after that it did and I should submit a name correction request on their website. So, I made this request on their website and uploaded my passport. Later on, I got an email response stating that my middle name is not required for my flight. Called westjet as well since they are my first flight from saskatoon to Vancouver, and they said it shouldn’t matter with them. Im just worried and confused now. If I choose to change it would cost $250 dollars.

1i3cvr4,1i3cvr4,,0,0,post,Service downgrade,"Our family has been loyal to Philippine Airlines for 12 years now. We have flown abroad using PAL most of the time, direct, since we are from the province. At least 3x a year as family and some domestic flight individually. We have noticed the decline of their services post-pandemic. I wonder if the management has done cost cutting. Just the past month, I have encountered 3 successive PAL-pak which is only expected on low budget airlines. 1. In our recent trip from abroad, we booked connecting flight because it was promised that check-thru will be a lot easier especially with several luggages for family trips. The PAL international flight arrived 1 hour late. And we have around 1 hour left to transfer to domestic airport. Instead of PAL staff to assist us, we were made to carry the checked in luggages by ourselves, got into the bus, and carried them down from the bus. It was very difficult because we had an elderly with us. Nobody volunteered to assist us from PAL. Also, instructions were confusing in NAIA as to transfer luggages when we arrived 2. While planning another trip, I called their hotline (mobile) to check our Mabuhay Miles. I was surprised that the agent could not quite articulate herself, ok lang sana magtagalog. Pero pilit pa nag English, self-conscious kaya nagkamali. Tapos she told me I used up my Miles on a particular date, when in fact, it was the booking date she found not the flight. I had to correct her pa indirectly. It is obvious that they have contracted out this service to a cheap agency. That was the worst CS I have experienced 3. Ticketing Office at the airport- We cannot purchase using Miles because services are down. We waited for 2 hours. And we were told it’s not the first time. Is this intentional so we will be forced to purchase regular ticket? Also, we loved the old staffs they used to have pre-pandemic days, very nice even to the elderly.

1hl6tlw,1hl6tlw,,0,0,post,Check in cardboard box in PAL International Flight,"Hi! Anyone here who has tried checking in cardboard box in international flight? I'll be going back from Japan to Philippines next month via Philippine Airlines. Thing is, I have a 27 inch monitor and I'm planning to bring it with me. I checked the website and found this: >For economy class service two pieces of checked baggage of which the sum of the three dimensions of each bag does not exceed 62 inches (158 cms) and provided the weight of each piece of checked baggage allowance does not exceed 50 lbs (23 kgs). [Source](https://www.philippineairlines.com/content/dam/palportal/migration/files/pdf/prpr1-as-of-15dec22-rule-115.pdf) So I plan to put the monitor back to its original box and put it in checked baggage. Since the box is quite thick and it's much safer compared to putting the monitor in my luggage (without the box). For reference, I measured the box and it's around 71 x 52 x 20cm (143cm total of the 3 dimension). Planning to also stick fragile stickers around the box. Anyone here who has tried bringing a monitor via the checked in baggage? Is there something I should know?

If you are traveling to any foreign country, it is standard procedure to do immigration and customs at your port of entry.

If you don’t live in Los Angeles and have to fly onward, you will find it is common.

If I don’t re-qualify for premier elite, will I then move down a tier to elite status I assume or will I start from classic again? (most airlines just move you down 1 tier/level) 3. Do points expire or if I keep earning they will just stay in the account? My last PAL flight was 9 months ago, my next flight is February. > The agent said I would “the meaning of thru to February 2025 would mean it will be expired and all Mabuhay miles points forfeited” The agent in PAL WA said she was reading thru some documents to verify as there was no Mabuhay miles team current available so it was non informative.

But to my surprise this afternoon, I received a couple of text messages from my banks that my card was being used to book a PAL flight. There were 2 cards that were used and both of which were the one I used to book last June. I can somewhat confirm that these booking were made by PAL or at the very least someone at PAL since the amount charged to the 2 cards were matched to the cents from the previous booking. So, the RCBC one went through while the Union Bank was stopped and was automatically tagged as fraud.

Second, how are you certain that the entire flight was not cancelled and not only your ticket? Did you try pretending to book a new seat on PAL’s own website to see if that original flight was still departing as scheduled? The more likely scenario is that PAL—just like any other airline in the same situation, I’m sure—determined 8 days ahead of your flight that the number of revenue passengers wasn’t enough to cover the cost of the flight, and so it cancels that flight and folds those pax over into the next flight out (and that’s why I always pick a carrier that has multiple flights to that destination later that day and also the following day). So, unless your flight was overbooked thus forcing them to bump off the lowest revenue-yielding pax, they would be shooting themselves in the foot if they moved you off your flight and left your seat empty instead of earning anything at all.",MNLmarc,1,,0,2024-09-04 15:15:42,https://reddit.com/r/philippineairlines/comments/1dsd0qm/do_not_pick_philippine_airlines_if_using_third/llfkjhd/,/r/philippineairlines/comments/1dsd0qm/do_not_pick_philippine_airlines_if_using_third/llfkjhd/,,,False,False,False

1cy8yyl,1cy8yyl,,0,0,post,Demanding more Mabuhay Miles,"Our flight was cancelled today, and PAL put us through tremendous stress just to get good accommodations. They were going to put us in a sketchy hotel with a 3.4 rating, poor security (jewelry was stolen from that property just a few weeks ago), and it was really far from the airport. They didn’t even bother with the transportation allowance for the hassle of canceling our flight at the last minute (everyone was at the check-in counter, others were coming from further places). After settling with the hotel stay for the night, I went there to check in. Shortly after arriving, as I was about to get dinner, the ground crew called me and informed me that the flight was pushing through in 1.5 hours (this was around 8:30 PM). With all the stress and rushing, I forgot to demand more Mabuhay Miles for all the stress they caused today. Is it possible for me to still demand more Miles even though the flight has already been completed? If so, where is the right venue for me to do this? Thank you 🙏",Mind_Explorer420,1,1.0,0,2024-05-23 03:27:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/philippineairlines/comments/1cy8yyl/demanding_more_mabuhay_miles/,/r/philippineairlines/comments/1cy8yyl/demanding_more_mabuhay_miles/,False,True,False,False,False
1cgu8sm,1cgu8sm,,0,0,post,Philippine airlines Carryon/Personal Item,"Hi there, My husband and I will be traveling to Manila (from Vancouver) on Philippine Airlines. I am very confused about their choice of wording as far as a Carry on and a Personal Item. So far our carry on fits the requirements and weight limits. But out backpacks do not. We have always traveled with these backpacks (no they do not have laptops inside of them) and they will carry our photography equipment as well as other belongings allowed in a carry on. What is the weight limit for the personal bag? Currently our backpacks are 9 pounds each? Does anyone have any insight? does this backpack have to be a certain weight limit?",wanderlust_pjv,1,1.0,5,2024-04-30 22:29:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/philippineairlines/comments/1cgu8sm/philippine_airlines_carryonpersonal_item/,/r/philippineairlines/comments/1cgu8sm/philippine_airlines_carryonpersonal_item/,False,True,False,False,False
