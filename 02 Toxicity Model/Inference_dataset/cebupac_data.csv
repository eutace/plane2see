1ow4qon,1ow4qon,,0,0,post,Questions about Cebu Pacific Flight,"Hello po, I have some questions regarding sa cebu pacific flight ko this december I hope y'all can help me medyo nalilito kasi ako. Not a first timer pero vague na kasi sa isip ko yung mga need gagawin sa airport since last take ko ng flight is grade 6 pa 'ko and I'm 20 now so almost 8 years din sya. Ang dami rin na nagbago sa terminal 3 may mga kiosk na. 1. Wala bang magiging problema if ako yung nag check in nung flight through online? (ate ko kasi yung bumili ng ticket so account nya sa cebupac yung gamit, sinend nya lang yung details nung flight/qr code) May napapanood kasi ako sa tiktok (i did some research din) na pwede mag check in through their kiosk, quarter to 5 kasi yung flight namin so naisip ko na baka mag online check in nalang ako para kahit nasa bahay pa kami yung check in baggage nalang yung iisipin ko sa airport. kaso ayun nga baka magkaproblema sa app check in kasi hindi ko account (email nya yung gamit, hindi ba sa email isesend yung boarding pass?) and if sa kiosk naman baka hiwalay kami ng seat nung bata ko na kapatid (bali 2 lang kami) also note po na balak namin pumunta ng terminal 3 ng 12am since quarter to 5 pa naman samin gusto ko kasi smooth lang byahe namin huhu 2. Pag dating po ba sa baggage ikikilo pa nila if through kiosk ka nag check in ng baggage? may 20kilos kasi ako na baggage. (baka kasi sumobra ayako mag bayad huhu, pocket money lang kasi dala naming pera) 3. How about yung hand carry po? may tig 7kilos kami na hand carry and 20 lang yung size nung luggage ko acceptable ba yung size or need na back pack? 4. Kinikilo pa po ba yung hand carry if online check in? nakita ko po kasi na possible daw po na hindi na since online yung check in nya. 5. Bawal po ba yung prutas sa check in baggage? ano po need gawin para hindi makuha yung mga pagkain(mostly prutas or gulay talaga) na dadalhin pabalik ng manila? Pag balik po kasi may mga dala kaming prutas, nasa baggage naman po sya kaso may nakikita ako na mahigpit cebupac pagdating sa ganon? baka ipatanggal sa baggage namin. also na experience ko na before nung pabalik na rin kami manila tinanggal yung durian huhu. this time parang wala naman kaming dala na durian kasi baka sa mismong airport na kami bumili (allowed daw kasi pag sa airport bumili) 6. Pwede po ba may pagkain sa hand carry? wala naman syang amoy, yung mooncake na nakalagay sa tin can sya. pwede ba sa hand carry yun or dapat sa baggage?? saka may plastic na nakabalot kada piece nung mooncake kaya kahit walang tin can okay lang sya. pasalubong din sana yun sa ate ko. ayun lang naman po, hindi ko kasi matanong ate ko since super busy sya sa trabaho nya. hindi kasi ako makampante eh.",gyalof4e,1,1.0,0,2025-11-13 23:56:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/CebuPacific/comments/1ow4qon/questions_about_cebu_pacific_flight/,/r/CebuPacific/comments/1ow4qon/questions_about_cebu_pacific_flight/,False,True,False,False,False

1osulai,no8adjw,1osulai,1,0.11,comment,,"That 4600 pesos for a roundtrip to Bangkok is indeed a fantastic deal, especially coming from Manila. Prices can fluctuate wildly depending on the airline, booking time, and travel dates, but anything under 5000 pesos is generally considered very good value for that route. If your travel dates are flexible, sometimes you can snag even lower fares by checking during off-peak seasons or mid-week flights, but what you found is definitely in the sweet spot. Once you've got your flights locked in, you'll want to think about what you'll do once you're there. Bangkok has so much to offer, from temples and markets to unique experiences, and sometimes planning those on the fly can be a bit overwhelming. For finding and booking reliable tours and activities, you might find a platform like [Viator](https://vi.me/XVT6G) really helpful, as it's known for having a wide range of options with user reviews that can give you a good idea of what to expect from different operators.

1osulai,no27v7d,1osulai,1,0.19,comment,,"That's an incredibly good price for a round trip to Bangkok from Manila. Normally, you'd be looking at least double that, often more, especially if you're not booking far in advance or during an off-peak season. If that 4600 pesos is for a legitimate airline with reasonable layovers, you should probably snag it quickly, as deals like that don't last long. Sometimes budget airlines have flash sales or you catch a dynamic pricing sweet spot. Consider checking the baggage allowance and any other hidden fees, as low prices sometimes mean you pay extra for everything else. But even with some add-ons, that base fare is fantastic. Once you've got your flights sorted, the next fun part is planning what you'll do once you get there. Bangkok has so much to offer, from temples and markets to street food tours and river cruises. When you're looking for reliable ways to book excursions and see what other travelers recommend, many people find platforms that aggregate tours and activities really helpful, especially those that feature extensive user reviews to ensure you're getting a good experience, like [Viator](https://vi.me/XVT6G).

Even if your DPS-MNL flight gets delayed, Cebu Pacific is liable to put you on the next available MNL-MPH (Boracay) flight. But if it's separate booking, then I'd worry with a 2h 20 between flights, considering Cebu Pacific is notorious for delayed/cancelled flights 🥲 and weather during December is also unpredictable, so more chances of flight being delayed.

I badly need help/advice huhu 😭 First time ko po mag-book and magsolo travel for a concert (Cup of Joe) next year sa Iloilo. Initially, they announced it for May 2, so I booked my flight during the seat sale (Oct 7–12). Pero kanina lang, they changed the concert date to May 9 (next Saturday). I checked the rebooking option, and nagulat ako kasi ₱3,000 yung change fee, which is mas mahal pa than my original flight 😭 I did some research and from what I understand, CebuPac already removed change fees permanently, and the ₱3k is likely the fare difference since I booked a discounted flight before — so now I’d be paying the regular price. My question is: Since May 2026 pa naman flight ko, can I just wait for another seat sale and rebook then (para mas mura)? Or worst-case scenario, I’ll just have to pay the difference?

I tried reaching out to them, but didn't get a response. I immediately got the issue escalated with CAB, but across the 41 days since my luggage was lost upon arrival, all we've received are their never-ending follow-up emails. The CebuPac rep sent 6 'follow-up emails' as a response to me and CAB in our very long email thread. What's there to follow up with their team 6 times? The luggage was already lost, and they won't compensate as per their policy. Is anyone able to get actual compensation for their lost luggage? Or is this just CebuPac's modus operandi to dodge financial responsibilities with regard to compensating their passengers for lost luggage?

Honestly, I wouldn’t want to give my personal details to a stranger (i.e., full name and date of birth). Plus, the seller can make changes to the booking if it’s in their account. Why not sell it to family or close friends instead kaya? Also, it’s so easy to make a fake booking screenshot (even I can make one and you wouldn’t even know it’s fake until you reach CS—not that I’d make one). If there are airline-initiated changes, especially >1 hour na flight reschedule, pwede rin ma cancel ni seller at ma kuha ulit as travel fund. Kaya ingat, fellow travelers.

If any one has any experience bringing boxing gloves to a Cebu Pacific flight. Apparently there is a rule regarding sports equipment, it has a list that includes Scuba Diving Equipment, Bowling Balls, Bicycles, Fishing Equipment, and Golf Clubs. All of those are very cumbersome to bring on a plane and require extra payment. Boxing gloves are very light (32oz for both), not sharp, and not cumbersome to store in a plane, so I am wondering if the rule either applies to equipment that's difficult or applies to all sports equipment.

Each passenger is only allowed to bring a maximum of 1 liter of LAGs. Measurement of 100ml per container or 1 liter per passenger is based on the size of the container, not the actual amount of LAG inside. If you are bringing in LAGs that exceed the allowed limit, pack them in your checked luggage instead. The following are allowed in your carry-on even though they exceed the 100ml limit: Baby formula, breast milk, and distilled water; as long as you're traveling with a baby or toddler Prescription medicine with a doctor's note or prescription Duty-free items purchased at the airport or on board the aircraft as long as they are sealed in a tamper-evident bag.

So, it would have been deducted from the account, but sa part ng CebPac it was a failed transaction. This would most likely put the payment 'floating' so it's no longer with the bank, but CebPac will not receive it as well. Contact both your bank and CebPac so they can check the status.
