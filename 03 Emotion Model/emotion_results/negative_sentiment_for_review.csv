I proceeded to checkout but got an error message saying the booking couldn’t be completed due to missing information. At the same time, my sister (on a separate computer) was also trying to book and got the same error. However, and here’s where it gets messy, when I checked my email and credit card afterward, I noticed I had been charged for one ticket and only one traveler was ticketed, even though I had selected two. I reached out to Philippine Airlines to request a refund because I wanted both travelers under the same booking number and didn’t feel confident booking the second ticket separately. But they told me the fare I booked is non-refundable, even though this was clearly a system glitch. They did ask for screenshots of the error message, which I luckily had saved and sent over, including proof that I had selected two passengers in the original booking. Now I’m stuck with a ticket I don’t want to use, for an airline I don’t want to proceed with anymore (especially after reading more reviews).

Upon learning the designated gate, I then proceed to said gate to wait for boarding (the gate was unattended with multiple passengers waiting along with me. 10mins to ETD, an airport assistant (cleaning lady) came down and said gate has changed (no email and announcement over the PA). When I proceeded to the said new gate, the gate screen was displaying another flight to another city. When I approached the gate agent about this issue, gate agent insist that an announcement was already made and about the signage display… I was given a “oh, they haven’t changed it yet?”. Another issue, I wanted to buy the 450g pack of Goldilocks to gift my friends and colleagues to which I was stopped from purchasing. Apparently some rules saying there’s a 300g limit for carryons.

And the baffling carry on limit of Goldilocks (300g limit packs) My first time flying with PAL and probably my last time. I’m baffled with how many emails I get prior to my flight about change of time of departure, aircraft change, and seat changes as a result (I appreciate the heads up) but here’s the kicker, I’m on a transit flight via NAIA and I can barely find any information about the gate of my connecting flight. Upon learning the designated gate, I then proceed to said gate to wait for boarding (the gate was unattended with multiple passengers waiting along with me. 10mins to ETD, an airport assistant (cleaning lady) came down and said gate has changed (no email and announcement over the PA). When I proceeded to the said new gate, the gate screen was displaying another flight to another city. When I approached the gate agent about this issue, gate agent insist that an announcement was already made and about the signage display… I was given a “oh, they haven’t changed it yet?”. Another issue, I wanted to buy the 450g pack of Goldilocks to gift my friends and colleagues to which I was stopped from purchasing. Apparently some rules saying there’s a 300g limit for carryons. My question is, then why even have them on the shelves?

1owwup4,1owwup4,,0,0,post,PAL carry on luggage size,"Hi! So I recently bought a Voyager Luggage as my carry on for my upcoming trip to Boracay, and I noticed that the dimensions are slightly bigger than the common carry on luggage size (56cm x 36cm x 23cm). I bought it at SM dept store, I repeatedly asked the sales person if it will fit in the overhead bin? They assured me that it is the standard size. I forgot to consider the dimensions of the luggage before buying. Here are the measurements that I took: L - 33cm W - 28cm H - 56cm w/ wheels, 52cm w/o wheels \*I think it is a ""trunk"" style luggage? And it is also expandable. I am quite anxious about this since it's my first luggage and it's also my first time travelling via plane. Do you think it will fit in PAL's overhead cabins? How about in other airlines? It's a week before my flight and I want to avoid paying additional charges as much as possible. Is it better if I just avail the additional baggage add on?

1m13dq8,1m13dq8,,0,0,post,They cancelled our booked flights without informing us.,"Is there anyone here who experienced booking a ticket through a travel agency and Philippine Airlines, and the flight was cancelled without informing the passenger? The flights were booked for May 12 and May 18, and we were told that the flights were supposedly cancelled on May 12 and May 31—but we were never notified. We only found out the flight was cancelled when we tried to do online check-in a day before the scheduled flight.Philippine Airlines and the travel agency are pointing fingers at each other about who cancelled the flight.Until now, we haven’t received any refund—they said we need to wait 90 days, and there’s still no update on our complaint. We had to spend almost ₱30,000 for a last-minute flight because the passengers were traveling abroad, and they were senior citizens who experienced a lot of stress and inconvenience.We spent the entire day in the car, since our original flight to Manila was at 6 AM, and the international flight was at 7 PM. We mostly stayed in the car because we ran out of money and had to borrow just to be able to continue the trip.

Nagbook ako ng flight pero naisip ko na wag na tumuloy. Di ako naka ceb flexi kaya wala na akong magagawa. Di ko na lang ginalaw at di rin nag check in, hoping na mag change schedule sila. Ayun 1 hour before flight binago nila schedule ko kasi full na daw ang flight, ginawang hapon kaya naconvert ko to travel fund. Ang nakakatuwa, may free voucher pa na roundtrip ticket. Hahaha ang saya ko nun.",2025-09-04 23:29:26,4,fear,0.4281987152530043,4.2836819679862653e-07,0.16909390122141235,0.0007679901190954661,0.4019388600037454,0.4281987152530043,1.0503454576756404e-07,negative
