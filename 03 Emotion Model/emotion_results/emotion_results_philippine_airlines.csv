1owwup4,1owwup4,,0,0,post,PAL carry on luggage size,"Hi! So I recently bought a Voyager Luggage as my carry on for my upcoming trip to Boracay, and I noticed that the dimensions are slightly bigger than the common carry on luggage size (56cm x 36cm x 23cm). I bought it at SM dept store, I repeatedly asked the sales person if it will fit in the overhead bin? They assured me that it is the standard size. I forgot to consider the dimensions of the luggage before buying. Here are the measurements that I took: L - 33cm W - 28cm H - 56cm w/ wheels, 52cm w/o wheels \*I think it is a ""trunk"" style luggage? And it is also expandable. I am quite anxious about this since it's my first luggage and it's also my first time travelling via plane. Do you think it will fit in PAL's overhead cabins? How about in other airlines? It's a week before my flight and I want to avoid paying additional charges as much as possible. Is it better if I just avail the additional baggage add on? Or should I just bet on my chances, and hope that they'll allow it at the check in counter? https://preview.redd.it/pn8gahf9881g1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22d446184c2c3ae54a08f4f8147a34363ce4d3cc",Green-Win1651,1,1.0,3,2025-11-14 21:43:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/philippineairlines/comments/1owwup4/pal_carry_on_luggage_size/,/r/philippineairlines/comments/1owwup4/pal_carry_on_luggage_size/,False,True,False,False,False,Philippine Airlines,"PAL carry on luggage size Hi!

They did ask for screenshots of the error message, which I luckily had saved and sent over, including proof that I had selected two passengers in the original booking. Now I’m stuck with a ticket I don’t want to use, for an airline I don’t want to proceed with anymore (especially after reading more reviews). Has anyone gone through something similar with PAL or another airline? Any tips on how I might still be able to get a refund or dispute the charge through my credit card company? I’d really appreciate any guidance or advice.

We have flown abroad using PAL most of the time, direct, since we are from the province. At least 3x a year as family and some domestic flight individually. We have noticed the decline of their services post-pandemic. I wonder if the management has done cost cutting. Just the past month, I have encountered 3 successive PAL-pak which is only expected on low budget airlines. 1. In our recent trip from abroad, we booked connecting flight because it was promised that check-thru will be a lot easier especially with several luggages for family trips. The PAL international flight arrived 1 hour late. And we have around 1 hour left to transfer to domestic airport. Instead of PAL staff to assist us, we were made to carry the checked in luggages by ourselves, got into the bus, and carried them down from the bus. It was very difficult because we had an elderly with us. Nobody volunteered to assist us from PAL. Also, instructions were confusing in NAIA as to transfer luggages when we arrived 2. While planning another trip, I called their hotline (mobile) to check our Mabuhay Miles. I was surprised that the agent could not quite articulate herself, ok lang sana magtagalog. Pero pilit pa nag English, self-conscious kaya nagkamali. Tapos she told me I used up my Miles on a particular date, when in fact, it was the booking date she found not the flight. I had to correct her pa indirectly. It is obvious that they have contracted out this service to a cheap agency. That was the worst CS I have experienced 3. Ticketing Office at the airport- We cannot purchase using Miles because services are down. We waited for 2 hours. And we were told it’s not the first time. Is this intentional so we will be forced to purchase regular ticket? Also, we loved the old staffs they used to have pre-pandemic days, very nice even to the elderly.

In our recent trip from abroad, we booked connecting flight because it was promised that check-thru will be a lot easier especially with several luggages for family trips. The PAL international flight arrived 1 hour late. And we have around 1 hour left to transfer to domestic airport. Instead of PAL staff to assist us, we were made to carry the checked in luggages by ourselves, got into the bus, and carried them down from the bus. It was very difficult because we had an elderly with us. Nobody volunteered to assist us from PAL. Also, instructions were confusing in NAIA as to transfer luggages when we arrived 2. While planning another trip, I called their hotline (mobile) to check our Mabuhay Miles. I was surprised that the agent could not quite articulate herself, ok lang sana magtagalog. Pero pilit pa nag English, self-conscious kaya nagkamali. Tapos she told me I used up my Miles on a particular date, when in fact, it was the booking date she found not the flight. I had to correct her pa indirectly. It is obvious that they have contracted out this service to a cheap agency. That was the worst CS I have experienced 3. Ticketing Office at the airport- We cannot purchase using Miles because services are down. We waited for 2 hours. And we were told it’s not the first time. Is this intentional so we will be forced to purchase regular ticket? Also, we loved the old staffs they used to have pre-pandemic days, very nice even to the elderly. Now, they are not as friendly.",2025-01-17 17:46:00,2,love,0.996333792347563,2.7050729169842753e-12,0.003578116035460609,0.996333792347563,8.809068289466896e-05,1.0631256515219694e-15,9.313754390310906e-10,positive
