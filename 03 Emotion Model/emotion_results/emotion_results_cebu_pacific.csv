1ow4qon,1ow4qon,,0,0,post,Questions about Cebu Pacific Flight,"Hello po, I have some questions regarding sa cebu pacific flight ko this december I hope y'all can help me medyo nalilito kasi ako. Not a first timer pero vague na kasi sa isip ko yung mga need gagawin sa airport since last take ko ng flight is grade 6 pa 'ko and I'm 20 now so almost 8 years din sya. Ang dami rin na nagbago sa terminal 3 may mga kiosk na. 1. Wala bang magiging problema if ako yung nag check in nung flight through online? (ate ko kasi yung bumili ng ticket so account nya sa cebupac yung gamit, sinend nya lang yung details nung flight/qr code) May napapanood kasi ako sa tiktok (i did some research din) na pwede mag check in through their kiosk, quarter to 5 kasi yung flight namin so naisip ko na baka mag online check in nalang ako para kahit nasa bahay pa kami yung check in baggage nalang yung iisipin ko sa airport. kaso ayun nga baka magkaproblema sa app check in kasi hindi ko account (email nya yung gamit, hindi ba sa email isesend yung boarding pass?) and if sa kiosk naman baka hiwalay kami ng seat nung bata ko na kapatid (bali 2 lang kami) also note po na balak namin pumunta ng terminal 3 ng 12am since quarter to 5 pa naman samin gusto ko kasi smooth lang byahe namin huhu 2. Pag dating po ba sa baggage ikikilo pa nila if through kiosk ka nag check in ng baggage? may 20kilos kasi ako na baggage. (baka kasi sumobra ayako mag bayad huhu, pocket money lang kasi dala naming pera) 3. How about yung hand carry po? may tig 7kilos kami na hand carry and 20 lang yung size nung luggage ko acceptable ba yung size or need na back pack? 4. Kinikilo pa po ba yung hand carry if online check in? nakita ko po kasi na possible daw po na hindi na since online yung check in nya. 5. Bawal po ba yung prutas sa check in baggage? ano po need gawin para hindi makuha yung mga pagkain(mostly prutas or gulay talaga) na dadalhin pabalik ng manila? Pag balik po kasi may mga dala kaming prutas, nasa baggage naman po sya kaso may nakikita ako na mahigpit cebupac pagdating sa ganon? baka ipatanggal sa baggage namin. also na experience ko na before nung pabalik na rin kami manila tinanggal yung durian huhu. this time parang wala naman kaming dala na durian kasi baka sa mismong airport na kami bumili (allowed daw kasi pag sa airport bumili) 6.

Not a first timer pero vague na kasi sa isip ko yung mga need gagawin sa airport since last take ko ng flight is grade 6 pa 'ko and I'm 20 now so almost 8 years din sya. Ang dami rin na nagbago sa terminal 3 may mga kiosk na. 1. Wala bang magiging problema if ako yung nag check in nung flight through online? (ate ko kasi yung bumili ng ticket so account nya sa cebupac yung gamit, sinend nya lang yung details nung flight/qr code) May napapanood kasi ako sa tiktok (i did some research din) na pwede mag check in through their kiosk, quarter to 5 kasi yung flight namin so naisip ko na baka mag online check in nalang ako para kahit nasa bahay pa kami yung check in baggage nalang yung iisipin ko sa airport. kaso ayun nga baka magkaproblema sa app check in kasi hindi ko account (email nya yung gamit, hindi ba sa email isesend yung boarding pass?) and if sa kiosk naman baka hiwalay kami ng seat nung bata ko na kapatid (bali 2 lang kami) also note po na balak namin pumunta ng terminal 3 ng 12am since quarter to 5 pa naman samin gusto ko kasi smooth lang byahe namin huhu 2. Pag dating po ba sa baggage ikikilo pa nila if through kiosk ka nag check in ng baggage? may 20kilos kasi ako na baggage. (baka kasi sumobra ayako mag bayad huhu, pocket money lang kasi dala naming pera) 3. How about yung hand carry po? may tig 7kilos kami na hand carry and 20 lang yung size nung luggage ko acceptable ba yung size or need na back pack? 4. Kinikilo pa po ba yung hand carry if online check in? nakita ko po kasi na possible daw po na hindi na since online yung check in nya. 5. Bawal po ba yung prutas sa check in baggage? ano po need gawin para hindi makuha yung mga pagkain(mostly prutas or gulay talaga) na dadalhin pabalik ng manila? Pag balik po kasi may mga dala kaming prutas, nasa baggage naman po sya kaso may nakikita ako na mahigpit cebupac pagdating sa ganon? baka ipatanggal sa baggage namin. also na experience ko na before nung pabalik na rin kami manila tinanggal yung durian huhu. this time parang wala naman kaming dala na durian kasi baka sa mismong airport na kami bumili (allowed daw kasi pag sa airport bumili) 6.

1ouxvji,1ouxvji,,0,0,post,Questions about Cebu Pacific as a first time traveler,Hi. Need some advice lang. I have a flight to Cebu on Nov 17 kasi What are the do's and don'ts? Questions din sana: 1. Allowed ba ang makeups na lagpas 100ml sa hand carry? Or need na check in siya? Or completely bawal talaga? 2. Allowed ba steamer iron? 3. Anong pasalubong ang pwede sa Cebu Pacific? Dried fish? Chicharon? Chorizzo?

1osulai,no27v7d,1osulai,1,0.19,comment,,"That's an incredibly good price for a round trip to Bangkok from Manila. Normally, you'd be looking at least double that, often more, especially if you're not booking far in advance or during an off-peak season. If that 4600 pesos is for a legitimate airline with reasonable layovers, you should probably snag it quickly, as deals like that don't last long. Sometimes budget airlines have flash sales or you catch a dynamic pricing sweet spot. Consider checking the baggage allowance and any other hidden fees, as low prices sometimes mean you pay extra for everything else. But even with some add-ons, that base fare is fantastic. Once you've got your flights sorted, the next fun part is planning what you'll do once you get there. Bangkok has so much to offer, from temples and markets to street food tours and river cruises. When you're looking for reliable ways to book excursions and see what other travelers recommend, many people find platforms that aggregate tours and activities really helpful, especially those that feature extensive user reviews to ensure you're getting a good experience, like [Viator](https://vi.me/XVT6G).

I badly need help/advice huhu 😭 First time ko po mag-book and magsolo travel for a concert (Cup of Joe) next year sa Iloilo. Initially, they announced it for May 2, so I booked my flight during the seat sale (Oct 7–12). Pero kanina lang, they changed the concert date to May 9 (next Saturday). I checked the rebooking option, and nagulat ako kasi ₱3,000 yung change fee, which is mas mahal pa than my original flight 😭 I did some research and from what I understand, CebuPac already removed change fees permanently, and the ₱3k is likely the fare difference since I booked a discounted flight before — so now I’d be paying the regular price.

1njwdpi,1njwdpi,,0,0,post,Rebooking or No Show,Hello! Need advice po. May upcoming Bangkok trip kasi ako to attend a concert. This is the main purpose po talaga. Kaya I only booked 3 days. The problem is there’s a fanmeet recently announced kaso di na siya covered ng whole trip ko but I’m willing to extend my stay for it. Ang kaso din po I need to be in Bangkok first to be able to secure a ticket. So I am thinking if I can still rebook naman yung roundtrip ticket ko kahit nasa bkk na ako no? And also sa pricing mas okay po ba magrebook or no show na lang then purchase a one way ticket? Sorry. First time.
